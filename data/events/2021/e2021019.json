  "description": "Or `Beinn Sunburn' as it's come to be known. This weekend started with the promise of delivering the Black Mount Four followed by some respective solo projects of the Griff and I the following day. We pitched at the Red Squirrel camp site, never again, and erased a crate of Sol and San Miguel while appreciating some Miami Vice clips. After awakening to the sound of bottles pouring out of the Vi Wagon the next morning, we set off to the ski centre car park to get our round in. The round went perfectly, in fact we even got a partial inversion looking over to the BookKyle, but then the walk-out hit. After Stob Chloe Adair, the sun showed it's power and deleted the Griff. He was crippled for the rest of the weekend and even the week to come. Dinner was oat cakes over a tense episode of Top Gear. The tennis balls sticking out of his neck and arms meant the solo projects on the Sunday were most certainly cancelled.",
