  "description": "A weekend away for Crug's birthday sadly for me turned into Beinn Lose The Phone, so these leisurely pieces unfortunately do not belong to me. It was however an excellent weekend. Glen Shiel seven on the Saturday, followed by a semi-successful stop bag of the Glencoe Youth Hostel. Then the ferree to Corran on Sunday for a roll with lorne, black, bacon and egg. Also finally bagged Drovers on the drive-out.",
