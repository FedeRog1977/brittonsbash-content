  "description": "Well I took off to this one prepared for last week's conditions; another good Scottish October blizzard, ice axe in-hand. But nah, it seemed to be back to autumn conditions now. Good news is, I think I have the setup nailed, and a real bed in the back of the car is essential. Even if it is in front of a sign in Fersit that reads ``no overnight camping''. This was another fairly routine one at Loch Treig, though the 50mph winds did want to disagree. I can't deny there was a point of turning back consideration when I got onto the ridge. One of those moments where you lift your leg to take a step then fall onto rock. But then, I remembered ``grow up'', ``weather doesn't fuck us, we fuck it''. I made it anyway. And back down the same way. I was a little disappointed when that I didn't get to use the ice axe, but it definitely wouldn't have been possible with snow on-route. The most interesting weather feature, aside from the wind, this weekend was the constant firefight between the red morning sky and the sprinkler-like showers. Also the big win of the day came in Fort Bill when I made the dinner ingredient and beer stop. DESPERADOS MOJITO in some dodgy looking convenience store on the main strip. Nice doods and some illegal imports. Not complaining.",
