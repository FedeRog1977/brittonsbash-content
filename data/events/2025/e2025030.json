  "description": "Returning to the GoAT for the (not really, but in my mind) annual round. This one was the perfect example of déjà vu. Some stable, low-lying cloud, which gave little indication if it was the mid point of an inversion or not. The Web Cam'ing Scotland didn't deliver much promise, but there was roughly a five degree difference between the DP and the air temperature, so my hopes remained. As I usually do when there is a promise of an inversion, as soon as the project shoes were on, I shot off from C. Vim Griffin and Young Fly. I battled the verglas with my raw torque, power, and mountain goat'ness to about 700 meters, where my wish once again came true on Ben More. There is was, a sea of white as far as you could see. The haze and sub-100% visibility also meant that the view diminished before the bounds of the compressed cloud, creating a fully white enclosure. It may have rivalled the 2024 one if put to battle. But I would never subject two such beautiful things to war. Oh, and we also recreated the famous 2021 profile picture in celebration of 5 years of Ben More.",
