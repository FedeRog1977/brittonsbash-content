### Christmas Roast

#### Beef And Gravy

- Beef Topside Joint
- Olive Oil
- A Red Onion
- A Carrot
- 2 Sticks of Celery
- Garlic
- Flour
- Port
- Beef Stock
- Fresh Rosemary

Create a trivet for the beef by roughly chopping the onion, carrot and celery, and arranging on a small roasting tray. Heavily oil, salt and pepper the beef and place atop the trivet. Roast the beef at 180 degrees for 20 minutes per 500g, plus 20 minutes. This will give a medium-rare result.

Once the beef is roasted, transfer it to a dish and cover to rest. Move the roasting tray with the vegetables and meat juice to a burner and bring back to heat. Roughly crush the garlic and add to this. If your beef has not provided a sufficient amount of dripping, add olive oil. Now add flour and brown. Deglaze the tray with port and reduce until thickened. Now add the beef stock and rosemary, and again reduce until slightly thickened. Pass the mixture a couple of times through a strainer into a saucepan. Continue to reduce the gravy to a point of viscosity you are satisfied with.

#### Sage, Onion And Chestnut Stuffing

- 454g Sausage Meat
- Olive Oil
- A White Onion
- Chestnuts
- Fresh Sage
- Thin Belly Bacon

Fry the onion until soft but not coloured. Roughly chop the chestnuts and add to the onion. Finely chop the sage and add also. Continue to fry for a few more minutes. In a bowl, add the sausage meat and the fried mixture from the pan. Mix until consistent. Arrange this into a log shape and wrap completely with the belly bacon. Roast at 180 degrees for 40 minutes.

#### Sausages

- Pork Sausages
- Thin Belly Bacon

Wrap each sausage in a slice of belly bacon and arrange on a small roasting tray. Roast at 180 degrees for 30-40 minutes.

#### Roast Potatoes & Parsnips

- Olive Oil
- Maris Piper Potatoes
- Parsnips
- Garlic
- Fresh Rosemary

Peel and quarter the potatoes. Cover them with water in a pot, bring to the boil on full gas and parboil for 10 minutes. Drain the potatoes and shake them well in the pot, with a lid. Empty them onto a baking sheet and allow to cool.

Half the parsnips horizontally, then half the larger top half further vertically.

Heat up roughly half a centimeter's worth of olive oil in a roasting tray then add the potatoes and parsnips. Roast at 180 degrees for 40 minuets, basting every 10 or so minutes. 10 minutes before finish, roughly crush the garlic and add it along with the rosemary to the roasting tray. Incorporate them with the potatoes and parsnips.

#### Roast Carrots & Sprouts

- Olive Oil
- Carrots
- Brussels Sprouts

Remove the firm bottoms of the sprouts. Peel the carrots and chop into 2 or 3 whole pieces. Arrange both the sprouts and carrots on a roasting tray and salt well. Leave them to sit for about half an hour, then toss them in the olive oil. Roast at 180 degrees for 40 minutes.

### Italian Stew

- Olive oil
- 2 red onions
- 2 carrots
- 2 sticks of celery
- 2 red peppers
- 6 cloves of garlic
- 8 tomatoes
- Passata
- Dried oregano
- Dried rosemary
- Dried sage
- A whole roast chicken
- 1 can of borlotti beans
- 1 can of cannellini beans
- Tender stem broccoli
- Artichoke hearts
- Kalamata olives
- Cherry tomatoes
- 2 balls of mozzarella
- Parmigiano Reggiano
- Fresh basil

Coarse dice the onions, carrots and celery and form a soffritto by using the olive oil to fry them on high heat, in a large Dutch oven.

Coarse dice the peppers to approximately equivalent width, and once the soffritto has softened but has not browned, add the peppers and continue to fry until all elements are browned.

Roughly chop the tomatoes into quarters or sixths, etc., and add to the pot. You should be regulating the gas heat already to ensure the ingredients don't burn. At this point you should turn the heat up to ensure the tomatoes break down before the other ingredients burn.

Once the tomatoes have broken down into mush and the majority of their water has evaporated, finely grate the garlic into the pan and incorporate. You may need to add more oil at this point depending on your gas heat moderation.

Once all of the ingredients are cooked and have lost all acidity, add salt to taste and any amount of passata desired. Remember, there are a lot of ingredients still to be added so be generous, but not overly generous as the only reduction this sauce will go through takes place in the cooking time included in preparing and adding further ingredients. Also add the oregano, rosemary and sage to taste at this point. Again, be generous as these will be diluted by further ingredients.

It's assumed at this point that your chicken will have been roasted to your taste. Whether this be through buying a rotisserie chicken or roasting it yourself, ensure it's ready. Deconstruct the entire chicken into sizes and shapes of your choice and add to the pot.

The further steps are easy, drain and wash your borlotti and cannellini beans (assuming you're using canned ones) and add to the pot. Chop the tender stem broccoli into manageable pieces, usually by perhaps third'ing tips or roughly eighth'ing whole, and add them too. Add the artichoke hearts and olives too. And finally, half the cherry tomatoes and add them. Mix this well and leave it to simmer for a few minutes. Add water or more passata if needed.

To finish, roughly break up the mozzarella and add to the pot, and grate in your desired amount of parmigiano. Bunch up the fresh basil and finely chop through it once, ensuring you don't lose any oil from it. This applies to any herb. You have one chance! Add this to the pot, incorporate well, turn off the heat, and leave to sit with the lid on until it comes to a more appropriate heat for consumption.
