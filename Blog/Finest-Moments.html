				<p>There are some moments that deserve the prolonged stare of admiration; those moments where you&rsquo;re lost in the view and Craig&rsquo;s rants of excitement about the Clachaig dinner later that day are nothing more than an ambient mumble blending into the atmosphere. Scotland has the potential to be one of the most stunning places on Earth given the right conditions and I&rsquo;ve been very lucky in 2021 to catch moments in these conditions more often than I could had hoped for. Despite my lack of decent enough equipment to even begin an attempt at doing these moments any justice, I still managed to capture some of the ones that meant most to me. This blog post isn&rsquo;t necessarily specific to hills but yes, all of the photographs here are likely to be of them. If you asked me a year ago what my &lsquo;finest moments&rsquo; were, I&rsquo;d probably say something like buying a 1986 IBM Model M or writing some shell script that opens the Vim Tutor and doesn&rsquo;t let you close it until you&rsquo;ve completed it. Little did I know, a year later I&rsquo;d discover there&rsquo;s no feeling quite like the one you get at 1000m while watching an inversion roll down Starav gully, through the Glen, and all the way up to the Ben while the 6am warm summer sun rises over the Buachaille.</p>

				<h1>A Late Summer Cobble &#124; 08/09/2021</h1>

				<p>This was taken at the end of a solo route I did on one of the last good summer days of 2021. I was on the walk-out of a Narnain, &Igrave;me and Arthur loop when I stopped for a fill-up and saw how beautifully The Cobbler was catching the 5pm September sky. It was probably the only photo I didn&rsquo; go into the day expecting to get surprisingly, despite how popular the angle is. Everything about this picture made me realise just how underrated The Cobbler is amongst &lsquo;baggers&rsquo; and munro enthusiasts. As of this point, I&rsquo;d done it three times and its versatility, terrain, views and picturesque nature never fail to impress.</p>

				<h1>Beinn an Lochain &#124; 28/08/2021</h1>

				<p>I had built this day up in my mind for so long that it definitely should not have been as special as it was but even then, it exceeded expectations. It was a special one for many reasons; I knew from the moment I heard Murray say it was his favourite hill that it would too be one of mine. But that&rsquo;s not all. There&rsquo;s something about Beinn an Lochain that I can&rsquo;t quite figure out. Even befre venturing up it, it just seemed like the perfect hill. You really get it all: magnificent views out to Jura and Mull; panoramics of the Cruachan range, the Lui range, the &lsquo;Larich hills, and even more southerly non-munros which are hard to find from other hills, if even visible at all. Also, views of two perfect inversion-ready valleys; a pleasant ridge; some scrably rock, spongey grass; some steeps, and some flats. Not to mention, this was the day I took my new baby (<a href="Allroad.html">Audi Allroad</a>) for its first outing with me behind the wheel, making it even more monumental. Yeah, Beinn an Lochain really is the perfect hill. All it&rsquo;s missing is the attention it deserves.</p>

				<p>I look like I&rsquo;m lost in thought in the first photo, contemplating all these things but, I&rsquo;m really not. The slow-rolling inversion truly captured me and I was fully fixed to watching its exit over the A83. The second photo captures a pretty iconic moment: Ben Lomond, Beinn Narnain and Ben Arthur all in one shot. These excellent hills define the start of the West Highlands. The thirst picture just.. is.. Beinn an Lochain. I mean literally, yes but also in so many more ways. It does such a great job of highlighting all the key features; the final push to the summit; it&rsquo;s well-defined ridge and subtly loud features.</p>

				<h1>The Buachaille &#124; 07/08/2021</h1>

				<p>This stunning shot of Stob Dearg (Buachaille Etive M&ograve;r) or &lsquo;The Bookle&rsquo; was taken on the drive-out of the rereturn to Glen Etive for the remainder of the Starav range. Most of the day was spent in the clag however, the clarity was excellent when the cloud broke which left the perfect opportunity to see every crack in the famous Curved Ridge and little pinnacles along the way.</p>

				<h1>Skyfall &#124; 24/07/2021</h1>

				<p>This day must have had the most contrasting start to end I&rsquo;ve experienced. I was incredibly excited to see Glen Etive for the first time on the Friday night from the famous north-to-south-south-west traverse down the Glen Etive single track. The view for the most of it was incredible however, as the night went on and the sushi was consumed, the cluoud began to roll in through Starav&rsquo;s gullies and rain began to fall. By morning not much had changed and we set off into the clag and the mid-summer midge. After battling through the fort of ferns and ticks, we were on Ben Starav and I wanted to be anywhere but there. Little did I know, three quarters of the way up the hill, my fatigue and slight depression would almost instantaneously turn into immense joy when emerging from the clag upon the final push to Starav ridge, to see a clean white blanket of cloud enclosing Glencoe and Glen Etive with all the famous peaks showing their heads. Everything changed, sloggy grass to dry scrambly rock and humid clag to a clear sky and warm breeze. The rest of the day ahead was perfect, just a bit of a shame we had to call it quits after just three of the five hills because there was nowhere to fill up. Not great in 30&deg; heat.</p>

				<h1>The Playground &#124; 15/07/2021</h1>

				<p>First thing&rsquo;s first, this, I consider my greatest achievement to date. At 23.94 miles and 9,162 feet, this 13.5 hour day is by far one of the most glorious I&rsquo;ve ever experienced. It was part flex, part chad, and part &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve just had my Covid vaccine and want to prove it doesn&rsquo;t effect me&rsquo;. And of course also, I was recovering from a stupid flu that I got, probably from the four successive weeks of 3am starts at my wagey job and trying to fit Strathaven cycles in around this. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll stop complaining / trying to make you feel sympathy for me. This was a damn good day. The Arrochar Alps still get a bad rep&rsquo; amongst more serious enthusiasts or &lsquo;baggers&rsquo;. However, how could you possibly deny the beauty and versatility of the playground that is these six fantastic hills? Especially when they&rsquo;re basically in the back yard of the major western cities. The payoff for such a cheap day out is unmatched.</p>

				<p>The first photo really highlights the scale of The Playground. The photo is taken from the summit of Ben Vorlich and spans all the way across the Narnain ridge, Ben Arthur (The Cobbler), Beinn &Igrave;me, and Ben Vane. Although it felt like it took me half the walk just to get up Ben Vorlich at the end, even after my fifth rice sachet and second tin of sardines, it was fully worth it for this extremely rewarding shot. I managed to photograph just about all of the southern West Highland classics: Ben Lomond, Ben More and Stob Binnein, the Lui Range, and all the beautiful corbetts. At the top of Ben Vorlich I did realise however, that all the stopping for photos had cost me a lot of precious time and that if I wanted to make my train, I&rsquo;d pretty much have to sprint from the forestry commission walk-out back to Tarbet. So yeah, it was running shoes on and A82 run-out round II. This time it was extra fun because every second car passing me wanted a fight and a group of bams in a 1-Series BMW (of course) tried to run me over, making me fall over the barrier, ripping my shorts and slicing up my legs real nice. Anyway as always, it&rsquo;s worth it in the end. I made it to the train with seven minutes to spare and the Co-op Costa cappuccino fixed me up stunningly.</p>

				<h1>A Perfect Day &#124; 01/07/2021</h1>

				<p>Oddly, I didn&rsquo;t even check the beta for this one apart from watching some old Munro Show content. I had no clue what treat I was getting myself into but I was desperate for a hill so I downloaded the Walkhighlands GPX file and hopped on my favourite train. It was quite the walk-in from Lochawe village station to Cruachan Reservior but wow, was it worth it. Even shots I got from about 300m were some of the best I&rsquo;ve taken. It was a great ascent once I was actually on Ben Cruachan; from long stoney ScottishPower motorways past the dam to a lovely rocky scramble-walk to the summit. I was not expecting the view from the top however. I knew it was a ridge walk just from looking at the topo map but I had no idea it would be as beautiful as it was. I was expecting a grassy ridge and plateau with a typical stalker&rsquo;s or deer path or something. But nope, I was greeted continuously glorious easy scrambling with views all the way out north-west through Glen Etive, Glencoe and Lochaber. And, all the way out over some Western Isles. The plan was to hike all four Munros in the Cruachan range that day however, I was enjoying the views and terrain so much that I decided to respect the route and stick with the two on the first ridge. It was worth it. This remains my favourite route to date.</p>

				<h1>Ben More &amp; Stob Binnein &#124; 17/06/2021</h1>

				<p>This photo was taken from the third hill in the Crianlarich range: Cruach &Agrave;rdrain (or Ben Adrian Griffiths, if we&rsquo;re on the same page). My route on this day didn&rsquo;t actually include them, I was just doing the four enclosed Munros between the twin peaks and Beinn Chabhair (or Ben Whore, if you&rsquo;re a friend of the Walkhighlands narrator). I&rsquo;d be lying if I said just the view of these twin peaks wasn&rsquo;t a huge part of the reason I was doing this loop, I wanted to see the romantic hills once again. If you&rsquo;ve seen the entry below about Stob Binnein, you&rsquo;ll know part of the reason why I love these hills so much; from them I saw my first real sight of &lsquo;hill beauty&rsquo;. However also just one week before this, I&rsquo;d had quite the interaction with a stunning hill hottee on Sgorr Bhan with the subject being these hills. So yeah, I guess when I look at them I also see wife in material in the perfect trad, braided blonde-haired, wide blue-eyed, flat-chested, wide-hipped, leg-covering, Patagonia-wearing, Clubmaster-rocking, finger nail-biting, make-up-averse Stirling hottee, who&rsquo;s Strava I will forever regret not acquiring.</p>

				<h1>Lomond&rsquo;s Effortless Beauty &#124; 02/06/2021</h1>

				<p>This was taken from the walk-out of the first round in the playground. It was one of the hottest and sunniest days of the year and this photo from the now infamous A82 exit perfectly reflects how impressed I was with my first solo of the Arrochar Alps. Not much more to report really, as the title suggests. Loch Lomond can be a beautiful place given the right conditions; the perfect gateway to the west highlands.</p>

				<h1>My First Time &#124; 20/05/2021</h1>

				<p>I still can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s taken me 22 years to find the love for Glencoe that it deserves. These shots are from my first 2021 outing to Glencoe, on the gentlemen&rsquo;s retreat. Sure, I failed Bidean nam Bian on this day because I was pooping my pants over the snow and ice near the summit, but this weekend gave the respect for Glencoe that it should have had long before now. I&rsquo;s one of my favourite places on Earth, which I&rsquo;m pretty sure is reflected in my Glencoe mini series over on my <a href="Instant-Gram.html">Instant Gram</a> Blog</p>

				<h1>Ben Lui &#124; 05/05/2021</h1>

				<p>This is another one which deserves its own self-titled tribute. Ben Lui has done more for me than I can describe. My first attempt on Lui in April was only my third hike of the year which was still long before I had any real clue what I was doing. I mean, I couldn&rsquo;t even tell the hill hottee we met on the walk-out the name of the hill. How embarassing! Anyway, I failed the first attempt because I started pooping my pants on a snow cornice about 100m from the top and it took me about 20 minutes to compose myslelf and slide back down. I returned the following Thursday on my first solo West Highland line venture, ixe axe in hand, with full intention of making it to the top this time. It was the birth of my &lsquo;go to the highlands and send and all day hike without telling anyone&rsquo; era. I&rsquo;d planned a very different route which involved a traverse all the way from the NNE ar&ecirc;te to the SW path from Beinn a&rsquo; Chleibh. I made it to about 900m again when the snow storm which had been lingering over Lochaber all day finally made its way down to Tyndrum. It was my first white-out. I was lucky if I could see five meters ahead in the best of it. It of course would have been beautiful if it wasn&rsquo;t for the retarded off-off-path vertical route I was taking. So at waist-deep snow, I made the executive decision to turn back once again. In days days succeeding this, I thought I was done with hiking. I&rsquo;d always just done it as a passtime to this point, with friends, never really appreciating what it could mean for me.</p>

				<p>A few weeks later something clicked. Two of my friends were talking about going out to send the Lui Four (the four munros in the Lui range) and, I&rsquo;m not sure if it was jealousy of ability and being considered one of the ones not capable or, just simply that I was so anxious to prove to myself that I could do it but, it was then that I decided to drunkenly book my second ticket to Tyndrum and try once more. This time however, I felt completely different. I had felt a different kind of connection to hills and hiking coming on, one which made me appreciate why people actually do it; the freedom and happiness it can bring. I studied up on the literature, videos, and started to autistically learn all of the hills, routes and beta becasue this time it actually excited me. I returned the following week and sent the Lui Four. From then on, it was solo project, after solo project, after solo project.</p>

				<h1>The Romantic Hill &#124; 24/04/2021</h1>

				<p>What I didn&rsquo;t realise when taking this picture is just how much of a famous shot it is. The cornice on beautiful Stob Binnein is a winter landscape photographer&rsquo;s dream. This was still in the warm-up period of 2021 during the 4am phase and wow, what a great way it was to kick off the munro season for the year. It involved one of my favourite ascents to date, the north-westerly Ben More staircase. No walk-in, no slog, just up, up, up! It was about three quarters of the way up Ben More when we realised just how good the conditions were. We ran into patches of February/March snow and the low-level cloud began to roll back in. After topping out on the hill, I realised I was overlooking my first inversion. We&rsquo;d timed it perfectly as well, the cloud was floating perfectly over the ridge between the twin peaks. For a long time, if people asked why I wake up early for hills or even why I live, I&rsquo;d show them this.</p>
