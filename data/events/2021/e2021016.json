  "description": "Ahh the birth of the perpetual use of the term `project' for hill rounds. This was a fairly routine proj to be honest. It was touching on the more enduring side but really it was just the perfect length and amount of climbing. Quite an interesting encounter on Beinn Adrian Griffiths actually where a fell runner asked me to photograph him next to the cairn, followed by a demand that I run down with him to Beinn Tachymeter to do the same again. As much of a douche as he was, I sort of appreciated the dominant pragmatic man's approach, so of course I did it. Lucky he didn't follow onto Beinn Suck Ma Groin or Beinn Pollo Ad Astra though. I'd already done Beinn Whore so no need for Beinn Drop All Your Height. The route was capped off beautifully by a run-out back to Crianlarich and a couple' punnets of Benmore Farm strawberries with the view of More himself.",
