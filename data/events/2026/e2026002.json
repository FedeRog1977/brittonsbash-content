  "description": "So yeah, we weren't really expecting even more of a throttling than last week, but Jesus, we got it. I think was was probably a very easy Corbett in any normal conditions, even more normal winter conditions. I mean, it's just a lump. But by the time we reached the snowline, it was a repeat of the Chonzie ascent from a couple of years ago, where every second step leaves you half-buried in the snow. After about an hour of heather and bracken hopping from the four-foot deep snow-covered path, across the plateaux, we were into the main event. Freezing level was around 700 meters, which meant almost 200 meters of traversing thick, rock-solid ice. It was probably the first Scottish project I've done that I would say it would have been appropriate to use crampons on. Minus 20 degrees does that to the snow though. The temperature got so degenerated that my phone died and the project used a whole 15% of my Garmin's battery charge! Anyway, after a frustrating, to say the least, descent back down the neck-deep snow, we were delighted to see that path to home. Safe to say I compensated for any bodily destruction on this project with a strong 4am desk and Dough Balls.",
