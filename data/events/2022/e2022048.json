  "description": "This was an unexpected delight. What started as me picking up a new office solution piece from PMB fast turned into the full PMB experience. It was a summon into L'Amirale on Friday night, upon which PMB honoured us with his presence. It was probably the best effort of J. Vitra and myself in a while. The intra-meery chicken and horitho haircut helped. Then back to see off the last of out eight-down. Good game of `nis on Saturday, J.'s first since the injury. But bodies do what you tell them to. As the great finale, J. and I were once again honoured with the company of PMB for a comprehensive spread at Turbers, along with many formalities and traditions. Finally bagged Tommy's for an oat flatters before helping PMB with some hauling on Sunday.",
