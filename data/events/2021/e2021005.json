  "description": "What I didn't realise when looking across from Ben More to Stob Binnein was just how much of a famous shot it was. I mean, it's no `Executive Producer: Michael Mann' freeze frame but it's up there in the appreciation community of Scotland's mountains. The cornice Stob Binnein is a winter landscape photographer's dream. This project was still in the warm-up period of 2021 during the 4am phase and wow, what a great way it was to kick off the munro season for the year. It involved one of my favourite ascents to date: the north-westerly Ben More staircase. No walk-in, no slog, just up, up, up! It was about three quarters of the way up Ben More when we realised just how good the conditions were. We ran into patches of February/March snow and the low-level cloud began to roll back in. After topping out on the hill, I realised I was overlooking my first inversion. We'd timed it perfectly as well, the cloud was floating over the ridge between the twin peaks. Although I think the 4am start was getting to the Griff a bit because he spent ten minutes arguing that what were were looking at weren't clouds, they were in fact ``inversions, Britton''. Ahh, maybe Skye is part of the mainland after all. We perched on the top of Stob Binnein at 11:30am and enjoyed the albedo effect giving us a 15° sunbathe. When people ask why I wake up early for hills or sleep in the back of a car on Friday nights, I show them this.",
