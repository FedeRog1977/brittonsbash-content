  "description": "Projer Baggerer and First Lady Jooma Loor took to the urban streets in a traditional 2020 fashion to run their first Waterfoot lap as a duo in over a year! This wasn't any lap though. This lap marked Projer Baggerer's 40th round on the famous route. A day to remember. Of course, there's no good pictures coz it was about 9pm so here's the ALL in the bay ready to chauffeur Jooma Loor to the start line, and some very displeasing diesel news.",
