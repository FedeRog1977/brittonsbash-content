  "description": "Finally time for the ALL to take to Aviemore. I was optimistic, sleeping in the Sugarbowl car park for the night for the anticipated Devil's Dick the next day. But the foot of snow I woke up to was said otherwise. We had to re-evaluate. It only took about 10 lengths of the Glenmore road for me to finally park up at the Glenmore youth hostel to recompose, but also look up and realsie I was next to a fine, fine Corbett. Good god, am I glad I did this. Only 20 minutes or so into the walk I saw that promising sight. One of the greatest sights a man can see; the sun peeking through some thin cloud. This turned into the best route I'd had in a good while. Nowt like a fine Cairngorm inversion. Certainly a contract to Griff's wasted on the Friday night, followed by a good drenching on a Corb' on-route to The More. We made up for this though with a good crate and storm. Sunday however, reminded us never to go back to Route 7. Like £4 for a roll and lorne. Oh well, CG worked his off on a sub-two and I worked my coffee off by purchasing a pari of two tones. Yup, it finally happened. Successful day in my opinion, topped off by the Bruar soup.",
