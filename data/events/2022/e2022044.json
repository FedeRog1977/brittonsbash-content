  "description": "Of course this wasn't the planned project with the three-hour drive-in but it just had to suffice. Started with a not-so-promising one on the A9 when the Atholl Arms was full and Dalwhinnie BAR was shut so dinner was bananas and a sad watery bowl of rice for CG. This was made-up-for by the long awaited Evan and Lombard in the FIVE at the car park for the intended Ardverikie Forest project however. Next morning didn't look so promising weather-wise for the three-`ro'er so we stuck to a local SubTwo'er. This was a mistake. The day weather was fine. Anyway McN.Kitch with a crate each, some CUILLIN BEASTS and a Debrenkos made up for it.",
