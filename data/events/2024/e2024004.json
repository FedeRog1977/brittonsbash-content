  "description": "Jack shit. Really the only way this one could be described. Of course, in hindsight, still worth it because it's a project and it's a Saturday. I also finally managed to check that annoying red blip off the Munro map. We didn't take the conventional route, we set out aiming to take the SE approach to get the circular of the Munro and the Corb' in. Not the finest approach, in waist deep snow and 50mph winds, but we made it. Through a slight white-out pre-summit too. Well I bailed on the lochan path after Chonzie but whatever. Worth it.",
