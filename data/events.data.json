But hey, ho. Yeah this was a routine one, not much to say. I kinda hate the Mamore Forest, especially when it is a sea of midge. Two good Munros in all fairness, just glad I never have to return. I unfortunately did not get Meall Dearg in on my way back, RIP. Could not be bothered. So there is one West Highland beast left to conquer.",

      "description": "It was another Sunday proj this time, once again due to a necessary wasted. Great desk this Friday night, with a great all-meat stinky pizza to top it off. It was a black-out one. They are always great. Anyway, up it was to almost the same car park as the previous week, to hit the most westerly Mamores. It was maybe gonna be the Ring Of Steall but the wind was not looking too inviting. After a slightly broken night of sleep and some meetings with the river, shall we say, the decision to stick to the easy route for the day ended up paying off. Although, not a very scenic one I must say. As you will see from the additional beer and new ASICS pics... After that, it was just a fairly routine M&S Fort Bill hit (there was no breakfast smoothie on the shelf this time, RIP) and off home for a venison ragu.",

      "description": "I had that classic just-back-from-holiday feeling, I needed some activity ASAP. But with the RoGeR accident on the Friday, and the summer writing off Saturday, frustration only grew! I pitched up in the Steall Falls car park with only the intension of completing the Aonachs on Sunday. Lucky there was a fine old-timer there to convince me otherwise. What a day; with all the makings of an ideal one: stunning falls walk-in, steep ascent, INVERSION, and finally ticking not only Nevis off, but Nevis via CMD. Legs are pretty done. That was quite a few feet for only 9 miles.",

      "description": "I hate to say it but, it had been a long while. With having the coming few weeks allocated to some fading in European cities, it was non-negotiable that a project was had. Especially with the complete lack in June so far. It had to be a good one too, one that was a long time coming ever since that dire sub-two. Felt great for the project and it was good to bang out three Munros on a slightly longer project. A very me project, I might say; big walk-in, then straight-arm. There could have been a little more sunshine to bring out the romance, but you can never really complain. I have to shoot myself over the decision to take the A82 home though, to hit The Bill M&S, as it was an Oban diversion day. Anyway, sadly no wasted this Saturday night. Sunday faded incoming. Too many of them recently to be honest anyway.",

      "description": "Time to kick off the Different Kind Hol-e-day series of the annum with a return to where it all started. There really is no need to give the rundown of the Thursday night travel. We did all the expected: airport bullet and bombs, overpriced coaffee (that lady was a bitch), Casino Royale to get hyped for Venice, etc. Let's just get to the good stuff. We arrived in Pakistan only to discover that our hotel in fact did live up to its three-star standard. It was by all means habitable, and by some, even quite pretty. Anyway straight out to the bars for some wasted and kebabs. Standard introductory night. I was feeling rather excited the next morning, for we were on an early start to where my love for Different Kind Hol-e-days began. *Whistle* *whistle* Venice, baby! Let's get facked ap, let's get facked ap. We actually managed to rise at a very decent time and slap an early morning coffee before the train from Mestre to Santa Lucia. There was even time for a stop in INTERSPAR!!\n\n... TO BE COMPLETED ...",

      "description": "Unfortunately weather stopped play this weekend, and we might be in this suspension for a while. Thankfully the McNeil caravan came in on a winner. We took to the easterly roads yet again with another couple of F*CKEDs on the horizon. A light night of not drinking on Friday was a breeze, with only six Estrella Galicias. I am converted by the way; making a concious effort to come off the strong boys. Got a quick one in the limited warmth and sunshine the next day to sweat out the day before and got straight on with the slow cook of the bolognese. Then we got a proper F*CKED in. Yes, another 6am finish. As always, Sunday was a write-off. Not young flies on the track anymore, us.",

I sort of needed to go for this after the last two runs of Vorlich, both after fairly large projs. Okay sure, anyone actually fast would record the route as a trail run but still, after a night on the dunkels, I will take it. We shot off in the morn in the bluebird sunshine to Inveruglas expecting a nice relaxed Sunday proj. But when we made it to that staircase motorway, I couldn't hold back. No stopping, not even for water, until the summit. And it was so worth it. I felt human again. All round it was a great day, not just because of the 9th place, but to have some of the squad rounded back up, to be back in the warmth of the sunshine for the second day in a row, and to gain some life on what can easily be a mundane Sunday. It was also the first project of the year to summit and return from with dry boots. Thats one of the minor beauties of the classic tourist tracks.",

In fact, it felt like a comic book crossover of Corrour and the Cairngorms going from Beinn One to Beinn two. It was excellent to have a proj I didn't need to think about again.",

This time, with hopes that the improving forecast meant we wouldn't have the same sketchy issues as last time. Little did we know. Anyway, it all started off well, even with a wee single track joy in the Ultimate Driving Machine. We set off into a stunning day, into a very me backdrop. It felt much like a Cairngorms kinda day walking into the valley. It was on the first ascent we realised how jack shit the snow was. It was almost like a fresh layer of corn flour lying on top of a sheet of ice. We made it over the first two, with great lugging knee deep efforts, but decided to call it quits before the ascent from Beinn Two onto the next Munro Top after watching a gentleman make a fine effort at some very sketchy route finding. It was fine though, we made Bruar, just, for a Scotch egg, and also made the pub for a micro wasted.",

      "description": "The time had finally come. The time to get the full loop: A82 up to Inverness and A9 down home. We were tucked away under the dam wall at Loch Mullardoch for the night before the first biggie of the year. It was all-in a good proj. Beinn two perhaps gave us our first ever small glimpse into real mountaineering. As we approached the summit, there was an obstacle course of light scrambling, cornice crossing, and neck deep exposed ascent, all while being obliterated by 60+mph winds. It was truly exhilarating. The rest of the route was fairly routine, in and out of micro spike mode. Although the winds did not give up. The fort of hags walk-out wasn't the most pleasant but the replacement of Landy track with grassy terrain was certainly easier on the knees, if not the mind. Quick stop at a newly discovered Tesco Extra in Inverness for Cherry CHOUFFE, some Dunkel, and some Hell, then off to the hostel for we set out to make a fine night of drinking. My severe undernourishment throughout the day however led to a slight hiccup placing me in bed from about 8pm. All good though, CG got wasted. Sunday was hard, I was sick, could only consume Lucozade, and I may not remember it but I did get us home in one piece.",

Not only may this have been the last of the fine winter projects, there was some very special company on this one; giving a new depth to the mountain philosophy. Where shall I start? Wonderful drive-in through those Crieff to Aberfeldy roads, and a bit of a shock to run through some mist and turn up to an inversion at the car park. Another amazing project on the early spring round three of winter. The Dunkels afterwards helped the recovery.",

It was back to the classic OG Glencoe camp spot, although with a sad realisation this time: you can now get 4G on EE down by the water, taking away the exclusive feel of the evening. Oh well, at least I could rock some reels. Anyway, it was an early-ish rise on Saturday for the first of two projects. Sgorr nam Fiannaidh from the Heart Of Glencoe approach was the first on the list, and the early-ish rise paid off. Some serious knee to chest bends were required to get the loop in. I'll totally go with saying the loop was deliberate on this one, nothing like I left it too late to cut up. Anyway, no matter what slogging it took, it was worth the reward. It was then a sprint back down to the ALL for a drive along to the main Aonach Eagach car park for Meall Dearg. With a midday start there, it was looking promising. Am Bodach was a quick descent in some easier snow, but The CHancellor, between Am Bodach and Meall Dearg, was deathly impassible. Sad, only a Munro Top gained on this one, but I'd rather be around for more Munros than on an Instagram Death reel, rolling down the side of Aonach Eagach.",

      "description": "We are going to breeze over the monstrosity of a pothole coming out of Killin and pretend that we got to the Lawers carpark with the full-sized wheel still in-tact. Apart from that, a good, successful round. The new Co-op, Killin was also a great addition to the list. As for the route, it wasn't exactly the weather I was hoping for. The cloud did nothing but rise. It was a solid ten miles straight in 30mph winds and clag. Also the ice scrambling on the rear of Beinn Three wasn't very encouraging. Anyway, still four more in the bag and a day of heart and lung health. Certainly makes up for the desk' on Thursday night with Griff. Although I just did the same again at PMB's after this, over a roast and some Star Wars. Warmed the bones.",

Their efforts to name each individual mound top down't' there in't' Borders is admirable. I am quite sad we didn't get to bag White Cleuch and Black Rig. Anyway, started off pretty windy but ended up being a decent proj. Not too much rain, mostly sunshine. It was also a very unexpected five-thousand feet day. Will never forget the legend on Beinn Donald One having to backtrack a fence to get cairn: sticks. Admirable. Tried for a coffee in Moffat afterwards but too late. Made up for it in the evening though with the first desk wasted of the year; some Double Disco's and Erdies. Ha, and three-quarter-bottle-rum.",

We didn't take the conventional route, we set out aiming to take the SE approach to get the circular of the Munro and the Corb' in. Not the finest approach, in waist deep snow and 50mph winds, but we made it. Through a slight white-out pre-summit too. Well I bailed on the lochan path after Chonzie but whatever. Worth it.",

      "description": "Well GOOD LORD, it finally happened. I'd say I was the lucky one on this day, but I have to say the lucky ones were probably Girff and Griff Jr. They got to see my hysterical response to meeting my heroes. Something which I'm sure will give them perpetual comic value. This was a project I was almost not even doing. The original plan was a wasted with McN on the Thursday, then a slow day on Friday. But no. No no no. Omega high leads to project. We took back to one of my favourite local routes: The Playground Jr. (Narnain, Ìme, and The Cobbler), and had an amazing routine round on the route up to the descent on Ìme, where I spotted someone familiar. Was it... Gerry?! After a brief introduction and handshake, there he was emerging from the horizon. Murray Wilkie. Life had been made. I could die any day now happily. What a way to close the year. We got a pic, took care of some formalities, and got on our way over The Cobbler and down in the dark. A full day of sunshine, omega high, snow, Gerry, Murray, and the last summer house of the year to top it off. What a day. What a year.",

      "description": "As far as Christmases go, this was a goddamn successful one. I'd consider it starting the Friday before. Gifts were gifted, the shopping was done, Desperados and Paulaner was in the fridge, Bordeaux and sherry were flowing, and M&S gins were waiting in the corner. Griff' was coming round to have some Baileys cereal, a.k.a. a desk wasted so great time to start the festivities. Big success in the desk wasted, finishing with a Danny Muhmuh Maccies and a trunk ferry home for Griff. It was that following Saturday I first discovered the theme of the week: wasted, Waterfoot, food, wasted, repeat. Waking up, I'd think I wasn't in the mood for more alcohol and excessive luxury consumption, but a quick Waterfoot and we were reset and ready to rock. Plus Saturday was the annual Woodfarm Hill round, so of course I had to crash the Scout wasted for that. Then came Christmas eve. A fine night in the Redhurst, broken up with intra-workout Desperados crates. And, of course, keeping the streak going by... picking up the speaker. It was yet another repeat on Christmas day. Final prep done in the morning, Waterfoot then straight into the rilettes, Bordeaux, and sherry. Also biggest and best dinner service yet. Capped the night off with some trifle and a restart of Doctor Who from the 2008 Christmas special. The week rolled on routinely. I got a lot of dev done, a lot of YouTube and Doctor Who, and a lot of Waterfoots. Although McN sadly did not join for the annual 26<sup>th</sup> round, I still got the Boxing Day trig picture. Skipping beyond a little too, New Year was another great success to cap the week off. Another great desk wasted, followed by PMBs with some Double Disco's for the last time of the year, followed by the next half of my M&S gin as Oxy's. 7am finish, and we all know how I brought in the new year.",

About the open doner we didn't know was incoming, that was, of course. Thankfully we had a slightly later flight this time than my Hamburg one, but it was still in Edinburgh. I was very excited actually, I downloaded Shutter Island to watch for the first time on the way out too. We got to the third world quite late actually so it was straight to somewhere for some meat various different kinds of ways, some beers, some doner in Fast Food Albania (yes that's what it's called), then some more beer in a stunning Northern Irish themed bar. We capped the first night with some amazing crepes which definitely filled a hole that shouldn't have existed. In all honesty, this is quite a short one. the rest of the holiday was pretty much a rinse and repeat. We hit some great bars, especially that place that put up with us for twelve rounds after our fine Italian meal the next day, and of course Duff. Although we definitely did favour that Irish bar. And we got about a bit. Probably had far too many open doners, but who's counting when you're at Fast Food Albania. Safe to say we stopped for a lot of coffee too. The chains felt very fancy. A lot felt out of place, we were definitely missing something. The hostel was strange. It was some weird ass vegan, blue hair place that didn't allow meat in the kitchen or even have goddamn locks on the doors. All good though, we got to sleep on our respective rags without duvets, being kissed by the beautiful Albanian air through that broken window. Also I Watched Fight Club again on the flight home because it was the only film I had downloaded, and jesus it's so bad. Sorry Rydo.",

      "description": "Once again, the time had come. The event the entire year builds to. for the first time, The Final Two'er saw took us the the Glen Nevis Youth Hostel for some redemption on a couple of hills from the start of the year. We stocked up and took to the Loch Lochy hills we'd failed the second of because of a pretty intense white-out. Gotta say, this time conditions gave us quite the opposite. It was a bluebird day with just the right amount of fresh snow. An umehur'igh, if you will. There is no feeling like driving-in to your project in the low-lying clag and frosted grass knowing you're going to emerge into something so great. The project set us up perfectly for the main event of the evening: service. The Final Two'er would not be The Final Two'er without a good Christmas spread. And that, it was. We took over the kitchen from 6pm and didn't give in. What a service it was. We got pretty food wasted and Double Disco Mango Smoothie / Desperados wasted and gassed out the room, so safe to say the Sunday project was out of the cards. Shame, coz it was another bluebird day. But, nothing a Glencoe Lochan and Clachaig coffee can't fix. That crisp white drive through Glencoe in the low-lying clag was also something quite amazing. Sort of made up for the wasted. Sort of.",

      "description": "This may have been the start of the Aviemore cancellation sprint but it was certainly still a good'n. Amid my Thursday and Saturday drinking period, I actually managed to hold off until Saturday this week, so it was a full clean week of no alcohol and Waterfoots. Then came Saturday. Got a foot in in the morning, along with the vital stop for some Desperados 440's and a Triple Mango. Quick routine stop in M&S somewhere on the MWhatever passing Edinburgh for our kilo, some loaf, and more supplies. Then wasted. We hit a half kilo pre-fucked, a fucked in a couple of the locals, a post-locals fucked watching some Spanish city tours on YouTube, then a post-fucked half kilo. Was good. Safe to say nothing more than a short stroll and scone the next day.",

We sort of forgot how much of a short drive this one was going to be compared to last time. I mean, a three-hour motorway drive is pretty much nothing compared to three hours of A82 then and hour of single track. Breezy. We had an excellent drive test running the Cheshire 2023 playlist, followed by a very successful first night. We hit a room desk with some Sainsbury's beers on offer. One of many advantages England has against us. We sit a Social Network in the room and later realised we passed out at 5am with Minecraft YouTube videos on. Sign of a very successful night. After some Casino Royale, ee went on our respective runs on Saturday then boosterino'd into the city centre on a beautiful day for the markets. Not before picking up a sad order of a Triple Mango and mini Jager from a questionable Spar. Although the Town Hall markets weren't open this year, we still got a decent browse of some stalls and outdoor shops. We got suited and bloody booted in the evening to finally hit a Smoke. Which was god-awful. And we were insulted for ordering the bottle of wine. Oh well, back to the room for more desk beers and wasted. Sunday was quiet. We ran a Booths Hale with Michael Michael and Eileen Michael and were then on our way back to project land.",

      "description": "This was possibly the most minimalist solo holiday I rocked this year. Although it did feel like a very suitable end to the solo season, and it certainly did not have a very PG13 beginning. In fact we could say this hol-e-day started in the OP with PMB, McN, and CG. What a spread, and a start to a great tradition. I don't really remember much but it was pretty much a very short perpendicular trip to bed followed by a difficult effort to the bus station to make the Edinburgh flight to the minute. I arrived in once piece though, and it was stright out to the streets to map out my running route and get some street beers. And of course map out the best grocery store bakeries for the morning. The first full day, as it usually is anywhere I solo (before the storm), was the most functional. It started with a nice clean and fairly fast introduction to street running, some bakery breakfast, then onto the days explorations. Some very fine locations were hit this day, indeed. With the best of course being WMF. Had a nice dinner in the Bavaria Brauhaus of Hamburg and a very pleasant long walk back to the DEGENERATOR via a pit stop for Desperados Mojito. Sadly I sobered up quite a bit on the way home and managed to get up for another run the next day. Even if it was broken up by a slightly worrying tailbone injury. It was a slow stroll north on this rainy day to see the suburbs. Nice, but basically just Cheshire to be honest. I did stop for some absolutely stunning Poke though. As stunning as throwing some raw ingredients in a bowl can be, that is. It was also a great, unexpected, opportunity to listen to the Dire Straits Live 1978-1992 drop that had just taken the world by storm. I also finally saw the Hamburg tennis stadium irl. Was just as good as it was in Top Spin 3. Also got a hamburger for dinner when I got back to town this night to keep Alvaro happy. The last day was another brief stroll, some bakeries, and off home. Stunning walk-in to the airport actually. And very nice airport. But always good to be back in Her Majesty's Kingdom.",

      "description": "Well I took off to this one prepared for last week's conditions; another good Scottish October blizzard, ice axe in-hand. But nah, it seemed to be back to autumn conditions now. Good news is, I think I have the setup nailed, and a real bed in the back of the car is essential. Even if it is in front of a sign in Fersit that reads ``no overnight camping''. This was another fairly routine one at Loch Treig, though the 50mph winds did want to disagree. I can't deny there was a point of turning back consideration when I got onto the ridge. One of those moments where you lift your leg to take a step then fall onto rock. But then, I remembered ``grow up'', ``weather doesn't fuck us, we fuck it''. I made it anyway. And back down the same way. I was a little disappointed when that I didn't get to use the ice axe, but it definitely wouldn't have been possible with snow on-route. The most interesting weather feature, aside from the wind, this weekend was the constant firefight between the red morning sky and the sprinkler-like showers. Also the big win of the day came in Fort Bill when I made the dinner ingredient and beer stop. DESPERADOS MOJITO in some dodgy looking convenience store on the main strip. Nice doods and some illegal imports. Not complaining.",

      "description": "Now that the ALL is back in action, some nice consistent maintained revs are very very very much required. Trust me. Was good to be back on the A82 beta, once again making the essential Maccies avoid. Lucky I was recovering from the Blu session and just wanted one-kilo-vegetables. Also my god, having the ALL bed back is so luxurious. It had been almost a month out of the game but it was a shock to so easily get back on the 14-mile-4k minimum beta. Walk-in to Gulvain was pleasant but dear me, winter had arrived at the top. I didn't even check the wind speed but it was high enough, cheers. This was probably my most dangerous project to date, to be honest. Anyway, the M&S soup and coffee made up for it on the way home.",

It's a shame really, I'm sure it's not all meme but like, we all know I was waiting for that one song to be reminded of Chad Michael Murray bouncing the Chadsketball along the bridge. Nah Mr. DeGraw was amazing though. I enjoy far more of his pieces than my meme'ing may indicate.",

      "description": "Safe to say the drive-ins are getting good now. Only 14 miles from Ullapool for this week's Friday camp. Saturday was an unexpected weather delight, waking up to a semi-bluebird. The route was also far more pleasant than expected, well to a soy like me. Weirdly it resembled a rolling Cairngorms route, while still causing some déjà vu with Beinn Ùrar's ascent, it's Munro push, the beallach to between the corbett, and it's descent. So great all-rounder. We also got not one, but two insights into our future. Meeting some fine gentlemen in their forties and seventies staying at the Ullapool hostel. God, I hope we're still rocking this beta in fifty years. Saturday night was very much a weapon performance from us in the Inverness youth hostel. It was some steak, vegetables, two cherry beers, and bed for 10pm. Griff didn't even wait up for a free tea the next morning! 7:30 and we were back on't' road again, to the same place we were the day before to hit the remaining four. The rain and wind, though bearable, did resemble moving from a Cherry CHOUFFE to a Duvel Tripel Hop. Worth it for the nine. As we say now: don't look at the weather; we don't get fucked by weather, we fuck it!",

      "description": "Back on't' road again with McN in the stallion. Not only was it McN's first bag of Inverness youth hostel, it was a double-down of two of the GoATs: Inverness and Aviemore. It was a bit of a restrained waste on Friday night. I think we were both up for it but we knew we had to make the cottage at the entrance to the Munros before the OAP pulled the shotgun out. So it was only a cherry beer and couple Discos for me. Bright and fresh in the morn to be speed-warned by the OAP and rock some excellent name-on-the-register beta at the hills. Was again a very routine round. Not in my finest condition after Paris and a week off the roadie, but still got through on drop mode. even got a ride out from the rich-looking Salewa dood with the two-tone backpack and 2023 Defender. Anyway, onto the good stuff. Over to M&S Aviemore for dindins, quick stop for the rum and off to waste. Yet another successful one in the care home. We were actually back in the famous, cursed 2021 new year room. Sunday was, of course, a very slow one after the beers and 70cl, but that's cool, got a new Buff from Cairngorm Outdoors. Success.",

      "description": "Perhaps Gino D'Acampo was wrong after all, perhaps not always nothingk good come out'a'va France. it was getting to that point again, tired of the wage slavery and in need of a messy one. Plenty of mess was had yet not half as much as there was in Milan. At least this time I stayed away from the forty reds and forty blues, which absolutely helped me avoid the down and out recovery week. Only very minor illnesses from this one thankfully.\n\nDay 0 isn't really worth mentioning as all it involved was arriving at 10pm at the airport and waiting about two hours for the only remaining bus to get me into Paris for about 1am. Kebab shop wans't even open, so unironically my first meal in Paris was actually a ... wait for it ... McDonalds. Wasn't very pleasant being woke up by three woke sk8er bois as soon as I drifted off either. Anyway, day 1. Following the tred, this was my biggest day (available on Strava for your leisure, of course). I basically just tried my hardest to tick off as many locations from my list as possbile. Being the first day, I also thought I'd try hit as many of the typical touristy locations as possible too. Yes, including Tour Eiffel. Only ate baguettes throughout the day, little did I know this was gonna become the biggest trend of the weekend. Friday night I was still stuck in the room with the goddamn sk8er bois so my only evening entertainment option was to get wasted on the bench outside the hostel, considering I was also kicked out for cracking a beer in the communal area. Lee would not approve of that kiddo. Day 1: big ticks, big wasted, big success.\n\nDay 2 was always going to be my Montmartre day. it was the recurring recommendation I'd had in the build-up, and it had something that resembled a hill; an incline at least. She's a beautiful little place, although the first bakeria I wanted to go to wasn't open on weekends, RIP. I did make it to the James reccie however, which was a great'n. Then up the hill for some views. But yeah, after that I just sort of reverted to my plan from the day before which was stop at every shop I passed to get wasted with cans. Worked nicely. I also made sure to load up on baguettes from the James reccie place too, for casual wasted street snacking. To be honest, I don't even really remember where I walked after that. Think I went back down to the river for some views and back around some shops. Aaaannnyway, Saturday night's alright for fighting, except this time there were no Aussies to fight off. Yes, that means what you think it does. The sk8er bois were gone and in came two far more pleasant, physically tolerable, less odor emitting ladies from New Zealand and Argentina. Then Slovenia entered the chat, and all those things Tate has said about central European señoritas was proven correct. Though our blonde bimbo vs. quiet loner, mountaineer, farm girl types may be significantly opposing, the observations are valid. At least now I could have some actual conversations. Of course by this point I was also like eight deep, so was ready for a group bench wasted session over another six. Yeah, that was a solid 4am finish with a Desperados Mojito nightcap from the sketchy news stand place.\n\nGradually, these days were getting harder to arise into. Started with 7am the first day, we've probably reached about 8:30am now. But that's an 8:30 followed by some serious grunting and groaning with the fellow residents. I walked back and fourth from the communal sink about three times before I decided I couldn't be bothered shaving. It took a lot of effort to make that decision. Anyway, New Zealand, Argentina, and myself headed on back to Montmartre for yet another Maison Lardeux. The gals appreciated the reccie, but not the walk-in. All good coz my philosophy always is: break them on the drink, break them on the hills. We parted ways and it was finally time for me to head south of the river to see some goddamn Emily in Paris locations. Drr drr! It was then I realised I made a huge mistake by not venturing south before. The gardens, gelaterias, Whole Foods wannabes, were stunning. Bit of a later return to the hostel this time as it was actually by biggest miles day. Effing Garmin dies though, so it only caught the ten mile walk-in. RIP. I thought I went hard on Saturday night but, good lord, Sunday soon prevailed. As well as being an arrow through my heart and my soul. Argentina and I took to the famous junkie bench again for minimum six more Desperados Mojitos, with the impression the night was coming to an early end at like 2am. Then the search through the carousels and the carnival arcades (erm ... the bar), searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades (actually the first person I saw when I walked in) took me back to Slovenia. The gaze said ``you are the perfect stranger'', we should've left it that way. But we ended up in the shooting gallery (the closed rooftop bar), where the promises were made. Only to rock away, rock away. Lesson learned.\n\nAnd the big wheel keep on turnin', no more neon burning up above. Monday was a day of sad goodbyes. What an excellent and unique bunch, they definitely fulfilled the expectation. She took off her silver locket and said ``remember me by this''. Put her hand in my pocket. Gave me a keepsake and a kiss. And that was that. Monday was a slow day, once again just wandering Montmartre and smashing baguettes and a jar of fig preserve after we all parted ways onto our own further conquests. All that remains of the story is that it was a routine trip to the airport and an expensive ride home. I bagged the Glasgow airport bus, lol. I did see Concorde for the first time at CDG though. So that was good Liam Neeson, When Irish Eyes Are Crying, IRA moment. What a journey.",

I mean, there was a bit of a black cloud that made us Everest for an hour or so in the morning, but apart from that is was glorious. Basically the Sale microclimate. Ferns managed to be avoided too. We were also clearly very seasoned, or scarred depending on how you look at it, at this point so a little 17 mile project actually felt like nothing.",

Thankfully no Maccies stop either this time, just Morrisons for some very dull ciabattas and bananas. It was a bit of a disappointment to see that The Old Forge wasn't serving food yet. Sort of ruined our dinner plans for the next day. First night was a success though, easy pitches and some stunning views from, Long Beach, Los Angeles. After a well-needed 8:30 to 7:30 sleep after some Quantum of Solace DBS intro transition, it was off on the first leg of the trip, Ladhar Bheinn. Absolutely the most depressing start to a route we've every had; just the perfect combination of drizzle, humidity, midge, and ferns for some screaming. Decent route. Zero views. Standard. And yeah, bananas for dinner Saturday too after realising the Knoydart shop was god-awful. We did get two good Seven Peaks in at the Forge though. Like being back in Glasgow. Sunday was routine, almost exactly the same again. More rain, more humidity, more midge, and, actually slightly less, ferns. Another seventeen-mile route in the bag. And we got some venison from the god-awful shop for hitting up on the Jetty, for dinner! That was a wrap. No joys sadly, though some stunning Landys bagged. Coaffie and three teas at the caff' (no, no litre of orange juice, a scotch egg, two rolls with lorne sausage and black pudding which was rather lovely, a chocolate orange, crisps, and a big ol' coaffie, and drove home in the dayurk) before the 11:00 ferreeee back to Mallaig. Some screaming. Home.",

Not complaining. Quick stop at, finally the correct, Tesco Perth for the £1.50 Lindor then a feast of sushware followed by bolognese at Lee's. Sadly no wasted this time becasue we still thought we might get a decent proj in. Haha lol. Wish we had gone a litre down now. The discontinued Brooklyn can over Quantum and some Skyfall was cool though. Just a sub-two the next day followed by a standard procedure Waterfoot upon arrival back in the only place better than Lee's. Meme, I don't actually agree with that but it works.",

      "description": "This may have been a European holiday but you know what they say, there's no such thing as a trip to Milan without a docking in America's South. Nor is there much sweet about their dear Alabama. Though it lives up to its reputation: refined, elegant and welcoming in the north; raw, rough, and wild in the southern swamplands. And maybe, in a drunken haze, sending you off with some souvenirs that leave you questioning your decisions. What an outstanding week, probably best it was a solo trip.\n\nMuch like the southern state itself, this trip seemed to go from refined and elegant, to animalistic in the snap of Frankie's fingers. Thankfully, there were zero SleazyJet compilcations this time getting to a from London. Coole Runnin' straight from Stansted, with a few episodes of Gossip Girl, to Whole Foods Kensington. You can picture my face when I saw the forrest green arches, I'm sure. Made sure to run all the 2016 mid-week anorexia classics. It was an early night in the hostel though, no trip to the cigar room for me.\n\nFriday, there was a mission. A successful one. Acquire Wimbledon grounds access. Haha, me? Yeah. Wow. As John Inverdale would say, the heavens were indeed open but that didn't stop PMB and I smashing the £8.20 pints and £12.20 Pimms over the JokerBitch match from Henman Hill. After the routine demolishing, it was off to Dishoom for a delight with AwazFM. Then of course, some gelat'. Still no rough nights. Still on track.\n\nSaturday looked a bit like the Casper Ruud grand slam record. the day started promising with a Whole Foods Kensington breakfast. But wow, PMB's office party was a bit of an embarassment. On the leader's demand, we made a swift exit for The Desgin Museum, where I enrolled in a masterclass in furntiure history from the man himself. It was at least a good 3-hour session. What a gentleman's evening. Whole Foods dinner of course.\n\nOn Sunday, I had to say my unfortunate goodbyes to PMB. But that's okay, I just hit up The Design Museum again to read the same books, and hit up the Japan House for some pieces. Then, then it was time. Time to make my way to the South. Wasn't too bad a trip with the RyanAir cowboys either. We're alive, but they must go through tyres at the same rate I do on those cargo donkeys. Yeah, there wasn't much to do at 1am in Milano when I arrived apart from get gelat' and rock a beer in the hostel. Big day ahead anyway. Bigger than I knew. The railing in the bunk across from me caused a little trouble with sleep, but all good. That's just the mixed dorm beta.\n\nHere we are, the moment we've all been waiting for. The 8am to 7am shift of just about goddamn everything. It was stright on on the road en toure: starting with the main glamour strip of opulence and browsing all the big dawgs; working ways through office furniture, architects offices, kitchen showrooms, parked Audis; intermittently drinking street beers; and, ending the tour at the one, the only Farini for a late loonch. The day was done, it was a wild success. All pices were gathered and some rogue shots were snapped. I made my way back to the hostel for some rebasing then obviously headed back out to Farini for dinner. Obviously. Few cocktails this time though. Back to the hostel once again for what I thought was a relaxed end to the evening over some Marlboro X Camel Rouges and couple beerias. Until I made that one comment I made about Dalwhinnie Distillery that took me fast track from the north to the south. As always, we'll keep it relatively family friendly here and just say: Alabama good, the Nikko special good, Vogues good, hard to fight off Aussies, being only one of two people in a £30 entry Milan nightclub and clearing the room of music and paid dancers interesting, Makeba (goddamn TikTok song) has absolutely no place being stuck in my mind, take plenty of `breaks' on a two-hour walkout, Alabama has sharp teeth that dig deep, 30-degree nightimes good selfie, always take a `shower' before bed, 7am finishes good. Cheers.\n\nAnyway, I needed a walk. Keeping it light with the shopping district on Tuesday with some very, very light browsing and hitting plenty of cofferias. Sadly there isn't a great deal to tell about this day, recovery was needed. But yeah Farini again obviously for dinner. Finally a real shower. Finishing the day with a slightly more tame repeat of the night before. There was a bottle of Limoncello thrown in there this time however, which didnt't really lead to any improved results the next morning. Especially when combined with yet another til-late finish.\n\nRecovery again on my final day. It took hostel staff dragging me out of bed, and a half-day session with the Aussie legend in Farini over a large graze to get over this one. After this, I basically just stared at the Duomo for a while, took a BeReal and checked for anything I missed on Millionaire's Row. Then, haw haw, I actually found on off-map Farini in the department store wehre I ran another graze. It was time to go. Back on the RyanAir horse and SleazyJet rocket, and back into PMB's comfort. Only came back with two flattening infections so the Wednesday night sleep was the best of all.",

      "description": "This project started with so much potential, so much hope. And on the Saturday, it did indeed deliver. This is a classic example of one of my favourite type of routes; long warm-up walk-in, a bunch of high level exposure, blue bird sunshine, some snow. Though on the subject of exposure, we soon realised it was that time of year when you have the crossover of ixe axes and suncream. Of course, I didn't have either. Most of the route, as I said, was in the sunshine, on top of the hills, and the albedo effect was certainly out to harm on this day. Project itself was excellent but when we got back, it didn't take long to feel the effects. So much for the cooking up a storm and getting wasted. The faces were not feeling it. Woke up on the Sunday to see a couple of red baloons on top of our torsos, so there went the plan for Sunday hills too. We had a quick depressing walk around Morlich and got on the road for some soup. YAH.",

We ran the classic steak and reduced Morrisons Fort Bill potatoes on the Firday, and I did develop a good hack to revive the potatoes, at last. Next morning was a great blue bird photo opportunity for the ALL along the ALLroad. This is one of many projects that highlight why March-April-May are the best project months. Just the perfect amount of snow to make the, already fairly easy, project doable, and the perfect amount of sunshine. The wak-in was a little boring but it's always part of the excitement. The reason we weren't doing all four of the Munros on-route was because we had the Admiral closing party to get to for our 7pm rezzie. But yeah, that went to hell when they said they weren't serving food. Back to Griff's for an 800 and debrief it was.",

      "description": "It had been a while since McNeil joined on a proj' and for the first time, it was a two bones solo trip. The perfect romantic weekend it was. Another loan of some washer fluid, a venison burger storm cooked up in the Indy, and the first outing of the new two-tones. What a perfect combo. It was a re-bag for me but also perfect weather for it. A touch of snow this time made the route a little more interesting. It was also short enough that we took a bit of time on the descent to piss about with the axe, Mark's new micros, and scaring a family of basically all da's. Tried to get a coffee in the ski centre but it was full of boomers who have no idea what a hill is. Unlucky.",

But the foot of snow I woke up to was said otherwise. We had to re-evaluate. It only took about 10 lengths of the Glenmore road for me to finally park up at the Glenmore youth hostel to recompose, but also look up and realsie I was next to a fine, fine Corbett. Good god, am I glad I did this. Only 20 minutes or so into the walk I saw that promising sight. One of the greatest sights a man can see; the sun peeking through some thin cloud. This turned into the best route I'd had in a good while. Nowt like a fine Cairngorm inversion. Certainly a contract to Griff's wasted on the Friday night, followed by a good drenching on a Corb' on-route to The More. We made up for this though with a good crate and storm. Sunday however, reminded us never to go back to Route 7. Like £4 for a roll and lorne. Oh well, CG worked his off on a sub-two and I worked my coffee off by purchasing a pari of two tones. Yup, it finally happened. Successful day in my opinion, topped off by the Bruar soup.",

      "description": "Third time lucky maybe? I took to the Glencoe shared room for the first time with hopes of finally getting those two Munros that had defeated me twice. Had a good fuel-up with salmon and big-heap-veggies, and a very strange conversation with some hostel weapons, and got a classic supreme hostel sleep in. Well, only to be woken up by some old dude thanking me for not waking him up when I came to bed?!?! Okay, cool. Anyway, I actually wimped out this time and took the alternative ridge to the schoolhouse. Yeah, no scrambling. I wanted those Munros. It tunred out to be worth it, they're a good burn and I met a good hill companion who had some fine reccies for the upcoming Wrocław trip. And sorry Mark, but the walk-out is not the most beautiful in Scotland. It's just a bog slog.",

We went north as agreed in perpetuity, but were constantly hoping that the weather would stay good enough to actually do something. We ended up getting a decent Corbett in down Loch Leven. Winds were ridiculous and to be honest, pretty damn dangerous especially at the very exposed points. Hey ho, it's us. The belting of Odyssey Live helped the recovery, and banished the fear. Aterwards, we rocked up at the climbing centre for a quick browse, I almost bought a jacket, as standard. I didn't, not as standard. Then we tried to get a coffee but ran into the army of SUMC, so it was a quickie to the door after that. Ended up getting a decent one, alongside some gentleman's chips, in a pub in Kinlochleven. Some electronic darts too. Not very gentlemanly.",

      "description": "This was the first sign not to take Ross on hill projects, but he was just teasing us in at this point. We had an awkward dinner, in Ross' opinion, which was made by Davey and enchanced with beer. We then headed out for a big ol' night on the Inverness town. This was goddamn dull. Music was quite good but bars were boring as hell. I cut off early and went to bed, but was then, actually to my delight, woken up by a shhteamin' and kebab-filled Ross and Craig at about 1am, who challnged me to down the rest of the whisky. I did. This led to some excellent waterfighting and bed flipping. By the way, it was CG's first time back on the drink since December, so messy he was. We probably got to bed around 3am, and it was one of those mornings I woke up thinking I'd only had a blink of sleep. It was 7am and Ross' was ready to get rocking and rolling though. RIP. We cooked up a totally unnecessary Simon Howie spread and got off to the Munro half way between Inverness and Ullapool. Despite the stunning weather, the river crossing only a few miles in broke us and it was soon off to Ullapool for a coffee. Yeah, a lot of miles for nowt. We still managed to make it to Roon's for the bash though. This was a bit of a slog given out conditions.",

      "description": "Another first for me this weekend in the Glen Nevis youth hostel. Also a first rounding up the trip with big L. Griffin in the crew. Some steaks for dinner and about 20 minutes of The Hangover before I needed my slumber. On the hill day, our hopes and dreams from On The Day were crushed a little in slushy ice and severely chilly winds but we powered on to use those ice axes in some waist deep snow and blozzard on top. Unfortunately it was a bail for me though after Munro number one. There was absolutely 0 fun in this route. The Griffs battled on but ended up rocking a Corbett top instead of the second Munro, so it was a bit of a fail for all of us. The Spean Bridge Spar vape treat made up for it though.",

Very industrial, very prison-like, but the perfect home to the first storm cooked of the year. Panang curry. We hit a crate of sugar free, caffeine free Diet Cokes over some Miami on the Friday night in the reception lounge. Was a little awkward. On the day, we hit a quick mothership Grain & Grind and got off further north to realise we could not have asked for better conditions to start the project season. It was from the moment we reached the snow line we agreed to make it the unspoken beta that we were always doing a project on Saturdays, given no blockers. So much hope, so many dreams from the season opener.",

We got wasted and exchanged christmas presents at Griff's on Friday then shot off, drum-and-welly-in-hand, on the Saturday. It's, like last time, a bit of a blur. A lot of beer, a lot of downing wine, a lot of food. But what I do know is, service was good. Even given the inability to roast vegetables in the oven, and the slightly undercooked welly. All a good one. Even followed with some darts at a very confused pub.",

      "description": "`twas time for the chamber city. Routine flight with the RyanAir cowboys, alright landing for them to be honest. Excellent first night in Berlers; a few curryvoorshts then gay smoking chamber for beers and reds. Up nice and fresh on Friday at midday for a treat out of the breakfast rouge dispenser and off to fishmarket south after some excellent coffware. Did some general strolling around some shops and Lime'ing, went in some questionable shops and ended up at a fine sushware dinner place. Then off to Bergers for two attempts. I'm sure you can figure how they went. Off to another smoking chamber then a cocktail chamber to roll-in the night. Once again, up at midday on the Saturday and off to Wilmers café for a bagers and coffee. Then a stroll down to the parlers but I got kb'd so I went a stroll around shops. Place called Lokal for dinner after like three down in some royal chamber bar, probably too wasted to enjoy it as much as it deserved. Onwards to some keeosks for some street beers. Then Pirers. Met a nice coke dealer and Crug got pretty wasted. I'll keep those videos and pictures to ourselves. Even after dinner, chips and a burger at a Rate My Takeaway chamber, and three kebabs; CG was too wasted to get out of bed on the Sunday so Awaz and I went a stroll around the rich district, went to a choccy chamber, and Five Guys for lunch (aha). Finally met CG to go to the one Xmas market that was actually open and downed some mullers and eggers. Then to a beereria finally for a final cooryvoorsht. Early night for the Monday morning flight.",

Uncle.Sank a good crate of frizzante too. We had a money-optimizing start to Saturday with CG remaining in slumber until 9:59 then it was off to `leven for my first fat dab of the Mamores. Shame, I was kinda hoping my first hit of these would be running all ten in one but, I suppose its `too late in the year' for that. Anyway, it was good to be running a sea-to-summit (sort of) again after so much time in the Cairny G's recently. The route was routine, good runn'r. The many-different-kind-terrain was also a good brek'r in for the fresh rubber. Pack-a-Punched up a Coop meal deal dinner and got ready for the weekend to take a big turn. Another 50 miles to Edinburgh and back to witness a Hard.Style performance with some management passes, a MEGAPINT and thicc milks. Came back down to earth on Sunday though, with the Troon solo followed my Christoph Tile.",

Unfortunately it was a return to ground level once again. Ideally should have done plan B which was Bidean again for the inversion. Instead I just observed the inversion under Bidean from Schoolers.

Over a week that the ALL had been in the geerage meaning I couldn't run the originally intended Cairn Toul proj because of the drive-in and need for an early start. So I booked my first non-west-highland-line highland train ticket and bukked two nights in Hamish's dungeon. The sofa sex chamber. The Aviemore Youth Hostel. My first time soloing a hostel, and doing it right too, with one of those nights in a shared room. Anyway, quiet Friday with one beer and some dev. Also some dood had a shared rant with me about ThinkPads, was excellent. `Twas the bus the next morning to the Ski Centre car park to take off on by backup plan, Cairn Gorm and Macdui. Excellent conditions straight into the very unexpected, but glorious, snow storm. Bit disappointing though, 60mph snow gusts stopped me from getting over to Macdui again. So I had a quick coffee and ran the walk-out, in a very Just Cause 2 climate-change-like fashion. Another quiet night cooking up a storm, running Mambos for two, then soloing a crate and Star Wars in the currum. Didn't get to do much on the Sunday, train times weren't very forgiving. Tried Route 7. Denied. So just browsed a few outdoor shops and went home. Much. Needed.",

The intra-meery chicken and horitho haircut helped. Then back to see off the last of out eight-down. Good game of `nis on Saturday, J.'s first since the injury. But bodies do what you tell them to.

This was made-up-for by the long awaited Evan and Lombard in the FIVE at the car park for the intended Ardverikie Forest project however. Next morning didn't look so promising weather-wise for the three-`ro'er so we stuck to a local SubTwo'er. This was a mistake. The day weather was fine.

The nought-point-nought-nought-five-five-hour drive-in was a success, with an 8:15 ressie at DorsiaVerna, until I found out the Pirellis couldn't take the heat on the mildly-stony single-tracks. Two flats meant it was Ben Hope foloowed by six hours of Miami Vice waiting for a tow truck to Ullerrpooul the next day. Pitched in a very inappropriate place and ran a Doomer depression Tesco meal deal dinner. Hit a sub-two'er the following day, in-line with Sunday tradition. It was probably the highlight of the trip. Got COLD quickly and headed to the Argyle Hotel for wasted, followed by a seafood dinner, followed by wasted. Monday was Doomer. We moved our tents to the campsite and ran the tour of the outdoor centre and localé cafés. Then the leisure centre, finally for a shower. Hit up a pizza truck afterwards. Tuesday was even more Doomer with my tyres being delayed til Wednesday, so it was another day at the leisure centre sauna and a Doomer pea and mint Tesco soup for dinner. And ahh jeez, a mouse ate my tent so we had to move pitch. It was an early Doomer bed one, although I didn't really get back to sleep after the craic kicked off with the First Lady's arm amputation because of the thunderstorm. Wednesday promised a new hope, the ALL was collected first-thing and it was off to Ben More Assynt. Successful proj. Groin injury for me however. So took the counterpart to Ben Kilbreck while I cought up on Better Call Saul in the ALL. Then the most Doomer issue of all kicked off. The midge attack had me running lengths of the road in the ALL with all the windows open. Only thing was, one didn't come back up. So yeah, 11:30pm set-off on the road home. Don't remember much of it tbh, fell asleep six times. So Griff had to take over at Bruar. There was a strong five hours of Doomer Jazz played on that drive-out. The best meme was realising my chain was on when I got home so it was another night in the ALL for me.",

      "description": "After the train-in to Manchester Airport us, we were greeted with round two of cancelled sleazyJet flights. After some debate we settled on a gentlemen's retreat to the Premier Inn, in Wilmers us. On easyJet of course. A few hay fever seizures later, we were in the Coach & Four you and me and you, running a fine two-courser. Also on easyJet. In fact, just let it be known that from this point until Munich, everything was on seazyJet. Finally bagged the cycle cafeé, then the god-awful pub next to the optician's for a game of pool. We retired to slumber over some yellow labels and La Guy D'Familia and Papa D'Americano. In traditionalé Wilmers fashion, the next day begun with some Giada then a Juniper all-you-can-eat. The day's activities formed a very soy trip into Manchester to browse Soylfridges and experience the glorious three different kind seafood with rice stick (rice pasta). I did pick up a good Crockett piece from Uni Qlo which made some appearances in Italy. Let's not forget the £15 of mocha ice cream afterwards. Once again, the night was capped with some La Guy D'Familia and Papa D'Americano. The third day under the dome started with much hope but a drone of Doomer depression. All the transport was successful though and we made it to Munich.\n\nSadly we didn't have anywhere near as much time here as we'd hoped. With our Munich leg cut two days short, we tried to make the most of it with the classic poached sausage and schnitzel dinner. After a quickie at the local gelateria to get us warmed up for L'Italy, it was onto the Hofbräuhaus to sink a few steins, then a night cap bar for a couple' more beer, large and a final pint to sober us up. An excellent night ended in a very rogue manner, with me running the run-out back to the accommodation to no ones's knowledge. Apparently worrying your friends trumps prime autismé. Anyway, a quick run for the bus the next morning and we were off to Verona; an amazing seven-hour journey through the Scottish Highlands Mk.II. I have a copy, you have a copy.\n\nHerhona, my personal favourite of the locations. And J.PELLEGRINO's too, I'm led to believe. Once again, a shame we only got to spend one night in this place because the accommodation and everything surrounding it was stunning. After d'loading, it was straight off to the first bareria of the evening to sink some H'Aperols and three different kind bar snack. We decided to tun the free-for-all dinner beta and end up in the place that looked best. This paid off big-time. Don't even remember the name but, first place we ended up served possibly the finest meal I've ever blessed my (goddamn) palate with. Some magnificent tagliatelle followed by wild boar ragù, served alongside a house red and some homebrews. The best of the night was still to come however. Romeo five-star beereria, Verona. The greatest drinking establishment on earth. Negronis with branded ice cubes, herheyhas, and Japanese ginseng freakin' zen garden something cocktails. A stunning arena. Big shout-out to Edoardo Bullio dood. The next morning capped her off well, with a glorious pistachio pasteria. We weren' leaving `til just after midday though so there was of course time for a bellini, negroni and herheyha pre-train. And yeah, the train was a bit depressing coz they still believed in masks and it was 30°.\n\nTo give a fair idea of the heat, I shall say that it took three legs with two breaks to make the two-mile journey from the staioné de centralé to the accommodation. The herheyhas helped, and the pizza lunch. There wasn't much more to day one, just dinner at a very average restaurant (still better than any UK restaurant). The squid ink, wait for it..., squid was pretty okay actually. Obviously off to some bar afterwards, one which I don't remember because they all blend into one. It was a 4am finish though, I can tell you that. A midday rise the next day saw us in desperate need of some frizzante and a coffeeria. We had a stroll and not long later came across a fine Farineria (Farini). Only the greatest pizzeria, drafteria, mojiteria and goddamn everything elseria in Venice (and Milano). We went a few [slices and pintés] down in there before the Trip Advisor special and another night of beereria, followed by that famous gelateria. Whatever it's called. Ahh this was also the night of Brando, and friends. And James' wannabe figure, the Celiaeria, who definitely shops at Celinerias. `nuff said. The final day kicked off with more frizzante and another trip to Farini, via the (non-existent) Casino Royaleria bank, for more sliceria. We bagged an excellent restaurant on the final day, definitely the finest we'd been to in Venice. It was basically a wine shop but their, whatever the name is for, Italian tapas was amazing. Anyway 5:30am rise the next day for departure from Four Different Kind Hol-e-day.",

After docking in the Newtonmore proj car park, it was sushware over a round of Mr. Tate's finest. The other kids had a quick bag before docking in the FIVE, then it was onto the Brothers In Arms beer garden. It was a proj however, so at a good sensible Supreme Gentleman's bedtime, it was time for the first use of the L'Hotel D'ALL / ALL Inn and the FIVE-TWO-FIVE Star Hotel. It was a late rise the next morning for a quick double-down bag of Beinn Two Behind Those Ones Mark and Craig Did When I Was Uprighting. We hit up House of Allroads afterwards for a quickie ice crémà and some lorne for the next day. AwazFM and I ran some pretty damn good steak and mac-cheese for diesel, over a bottle of Wilmslow's finest Casa Italinio Chianti. Capped the night with an even more successful one at the Dalwhinnie lodge where we double-downed on pint and cocktail each round. I'm pretty sure that, even though we didn't realize it, we were kicked out. Back at Lee's, Jooma and I ran a night cap of Ferris Bueller's Day Off over six teas. Ran a couple' lorne for brekkie the next day then hit up Beinn One Hundred across from Beinn Day Before while AwazFM uprighted it in the FIVE.",

I planned to run all three southerly Munros however, by the time I'd made my way through the famous bog sink pits on the Beinn na Lap walk-out, if I'd added in the extra two, it would be Corrour-Glasgow run-out. So a trip to the café and an episode of Selling Sunset it was. I also hit my first 39bpm in the cafe but it jumped back up to 42 when I grabbed my phone to capture the moment, RIP.",

This hill certainly redeemed itself this weekend with the sun, snow, burn and Merrill Lynch corb. The Chinese chicken roast dinner service went excellently, ending with a standing ovation as Mark and I made our way from the kitchen, through the dining room, to the Range Rover. After that, it was off to the Clachaig for a heavy one followed by a crate and a Lewis dram before bed. Sunday saw a slower start and a very challenging lap of Glencoe Lochan. Accompanied by a debriefing over some Oomer content. Five erosions and on the road again. We made a pit stop in Tyndrum to finally bag a cheese wageburger at TJ's.",

This time, from Murray's famous Perth Tesco. Many a beer had already been deleted upon arrival and to be honest, it was a blur from then to 4am. I removed 4l of Aviemore's finest water from existence before bed so obviously I was fine for a 9am wake-up and promptly obliterated some lorne, ran a run and helped the mighty Hamish clean up the embarassment in the care home. When the rest finally dragged themselves up at 2pm, it was off to Loch Morlich for a 20 meter walk then back to the currum for Jile, Skyfall and tea. And, just a little rum and trop. Back when we were drinkers, this would have been laughable however now that we are seasoned tea enthusiasts, we sought continuation of the warm embrace of a council brew in a trip to The House of Bruar and Hettie's Tea Rooms, Pitlochry to break up the Sunday drive home.",

Started it off with the classic Die Hard sesh at Paul's on Christmas Eve to get in the festive spirit, then returned home for a safe and conservative 3am to be up and fresh the next morning for the big day. Started the 25th with some Spider-Man 3 and a breakfast of porridge with Lindor, Terrance Montgomergy's Chocolate Orange, and fruit jellies, as tradition requires. After wrapping some sausages and part-boiling some vegetables, I thought it'd be appropriate to take a short run in anticipation of the incoming Carbsmas. I started cooking at around 4pm over a port, a sherry, a whisky, some Friends, and the classic Christmas not-a-Christmas-film film Shrek Forever After. Boxing day was pretty much the same, after a Waterfoot loop with Mark, its was back on the cheese, port and a good five hours of Lily Collins while constructing the Lego 1985 quattro Sport.",

In fact, Ben More's ascent is by far my favourite incline; steep, grindy and so rewarding. That's why if a perfect weather day ever came by, this would be how I chose to spend my day. And that's exactly what happened, a passing by of the TV while the BBC weather gal spoke of the possible inversion across the entirety of the west of Scotland had me swifty cancel my Firday night plans and immediately book my west highland ticket! With stunning inversions and 17° summits, you can see for yourself that it paid off.",

The drinking started early in the FIVE on the drive-in but I wasn't complaining, we had plenty-a-crate to work out way through. Stuck to the traditional loaf on the drive-in too, before the M&S roast beef in the Aviemore Youth Hostel. We worked our way through about half a crate each then headed boys én tourè to Mambo's, where Griff and I spent the evening sparking some questionable debates in the SUMC chat. They headed to whatever that Aviemore nightclub is called but of course I did a Lewis and just went back to the hostel and solo'd a few' in an arm chair. This was the least messy of the nights. We were all still a little tender the next day however, and so saw the birth of the Aviemore care home. Lorne and trop down and off Murk and I went for an attempted walk around Loch Morlich. We only made it through the front door of the Pine Marten though. Couple coffees and the worst chips of our lives later, we attempted the walk-out. Oxy and the Griff had to rescue us in the FIVE on their abseiling drive-out however. Good Thai curry sobered us up right good after that. Gained me the title of the `Highland chef' from Oxy. Anyway, after that it was straight back on the crates and `Lewis measure' drams. That's like a 300ml glass. Got us a good three bottles down between four people in no time. They headed back out to the nightclub after that. Who knows what I did. Give them the room key certainly wansn't something I did. Woke up to smashed-up tube, cans, toilet paper and a wet flare sign the next morning so must have been a good one. Wee Route 7 Cafe sorted us out the next morning. Drive-out was very questionable. Griff didn't speak a word.",

After the Miami Vice Brother's Keeper feature length pilot, it was off to the Saab's double bed all to myself while Craig pitched. It was a midge-ridden start to the round on Saturday but once I'd battled off my fatigue from the week of 3am starts and Fenwick-Wind Farm loops and we'd made our way through the fort of ferns and low-level clag, it was straight into a clean white blanket of cloud enclosing Glencoeand Glen Etive with all the famous peaks showing their heads..

It was part flex, part chad, and part ``I've just had my Coooviiid Noynteen vaccine and want to prove it doesn't effect me''. I was also recovering from a flu that I got, from the dumb 3am starts at my wagey job cucking and grinding for the paper (later leading to the A6 C6 TDV allroad TDI quattro, however), and grinding daily Strathaven cycles. Anyway, no need to complain, I deserve no sympathy. This was a damn good day. The Arrochar Alps still get a bad rep' amongst more serious enthusiasts or `baggers' (actually soys). However, how could you possibly deny the beauty and versatility of the playground that is these stunning four Munros, two Corbetts, and Corbett top? Especially when they're basically in the back yard of the major western cities. The payoff for such a cheap day out is unmatched. Of course en route to having only seven minutes to spare at the train station, this route also saw the famous coining of the A82 Run-Out and its components: Slingshot, Freerun Frenzy, Tightrope Walk 1, and Tightrope Walk 2.",

It was the first sushi dinner, with a selection of katsu and salmon rolls I'd picked up from the one, the only (M&S) earlier. Then it was onto the Clachaig for our first impromptu wasted on the fine ales of the west highlands. We teased the end of the night with a short round of the first 20 or so meters of Oontag Etag then a couple' bags of Percy Pigs. Griff could't be bothered pitching his toynt so the ultimate functionality of trunk-bunk sleeping came into play for the first time. The hill day was a success to some degree. Naive, inexperienced me chickened out at the scrambling however, I wasn' disappointed. Probably because I ended up having an exhilarating hour's worth of hill briefing with the finest Stirling trad braided brunette, wide brown-eyed, flat-chested, wide-hipped, five-foot-four-inch, 7% body fat, well-spoken, leg-covering, Patagonia-wearing, Scarpa trotting, Walkhighlands wielding, soycial media-avoiding, Clubmaster-rocking, fingernail-biting, make-up-averse wife material on my descent.

It was another monumental day, seeing my longest project to date and the birth of the A82 run-out from the Ben Vorlich road. Sadly I didn't hit Vorlich though because of, you guessed it, train times. However, the 3 mile run across the A82 and adjacent beach certainly made for the equivalent of another munro. For other Wojak reasons, this day was slightly monumental in another way. I mean, not in any way which lives up to the project itself but certainly in satisfaction of my `controysoytion to soyciety' and my `footure'. I got the call half way Beinn Ìme from ScoyttishSoyer to tell me I'd been accepted on the scholarship. That is, I wouldn't be paying the eight large for my upcoming Strathbloat course.

We all know about my two failed attempts on Ben Lui, laughable. ``Dude you're a bloody embarrassment''. But a few weeks later something clicked. Two of my friends were talking about going out to send the Lui Four and I'm not sure if it was jealousy of ability and being considered one of those incapable or, just simply that I was so anxious to prove to myself that I could do it but, it was in that moment that I drunkenly decided to book my second ticket to Tyndrum for one more attempt. Just in the passing of these few weeks though, my attitude changed. I'd felt a different kind of connection to hills and why people want to escape to them. I began to appreciate the freedom and happiness it can bring, instead of ticks on a 2007 website. So, I studied up on the literature, videos, and started to autistically learn all the hill and route beta because this time it actually excited me, it wasn't just a task. I made my appearance in Tyndrum the following week and sent the Lui four. From then on, it was a summer of solo project, followed by solo project, followed by weekend duo project.

I'd planned a very different route which involved a traverse all the way from the NNE arête to the SW path from Beinn a' Chleibh.

The cornice Stob Binnein is a winter landscape photographer's dream. This project was still in the warm-up period of 2021 during the 4am phase and wow, what a great way it was to kick off the munro season for the year. It involved one of my favourite ascents to date: the north-westerly Ben More staircase. No walk-in, no slog, just up, up, up! It was about three quarters of the way up Ben More when we realised just how good the conditions were. We ran into patches of February/March snow and the low-level cloud began to roll back in. After topping out on the hill, I realised I was overlooking my first inversion. We'd timed it perfectly as well, the cloud was floating over the ridge between the twin peaks. Although I think the 4am start was getting to the Griff a bit because he spent ten minutes arguing that what were were looking at weren't clouds, they were in fact ``inversions, Britton''. Ahh, maybe Skye is part of the mainland after all. We perched on the top of Stob Binnein at 11:30am and enjoyed the albedo effect giving us a 15° sunbathe.
