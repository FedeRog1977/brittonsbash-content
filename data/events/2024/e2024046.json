  "description": "I wish I could say this was anything like Mullardoch, but it was most disappointing actually. The RS6 Kerosene style crash was worth the two-hour wait on Friday night, so that actually kicked us off to quite a positive start. And, I finally bagged a Newtonmore Co-op overnight. But there wasn't anywhere near enough of a wind and snow battering to satisfy me. 40mph max. RIP.",
