\section{Game Theory}

	\subsection{Definitions}

	\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item \textit{Welfare Economics}: Generalising equilibriums. Competitive markets provide an incentive for firms to produce what customers want. Markets rock in fair play.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Theorem 1: Every competitive economy is Pareto Efficient.
			\item Theorem 2: Every Pareto Efficient allocation of resources can be achieved in competitive markets (w/ appropriate redistribution between parties).
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textit{Pareto Efficiency}: No additional person can be made better off without making someone else worse off. There should be no government intervention. Redistribution can take place meaning there is redistribution between parties within the economy rather than externally.
		\item \textit{Prisoner's Dilemma}: Pursuing your own interests leads to inefficient markets because, using the prison example, if both people choose to confess, they get full long time each. If they both lie, they get full short time. If one lies and one confesses, the one who confesses gets reduction but the liar gets full time. This is risk. Both could deny for 2 years of the other lies (gets 10 years). But then they both risk getting 8 years. If they both deny they both get the full short time (3 years). Denying is best for them both but confessing could, but only could, be best for a single one of them.
		\item \textit{Rationality}: Players will choose the option with the best payoff for themselves. But back to the Joey and Phoebe, if you are choosing the best for yourself, surely the opponent must be doing the same so can you forecast? Or will they think the same and one-up you?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textit{Common Knowledge of Rationality}: Where players don’t just know they possible outcomes of their decisions, they know the possible outcomes of the other’s decisions. But recall the prisoner’s dilemma.
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textit{Game Theory}: Our actions have external consequences. They effect the environment and all things around us (smoking example).
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textit{Non-Cooperative Game}: In it for your own gain and only that.
			\item \textit{Information Game}: Everyone knows they are playing.
			\item \textit{Stage Game}: May be repeated (e.g. rearranging cost agreements).
			\item \textit{Simultaneous Game} (Type 1): When players do not know the move of the opponent and move at the same time.
			\item \textit{Sequential Game} (Type 2): When players know the move of the other player and can make their decision based on the opponent’s move. 
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textit{Imperfect/Perfect Information}: Not being able to see the others’ choice. Your outcome will always depend on their choice but your decision won’t. Or, you have information about their decision to look at as they have make it (historic forecasting).
		\item \textit{Strategic Uncertainty} (When Simultaneous): Players must base decisions on what they think the other player will play as they do not know. But then they must consider what they think the opponent’s move will be but then, the opponent will surely think they will be thinking this and so make a different move and make the same prediction about their opponent... in practice usually it comes back round to them making the first decision that you predicted they would make (Joey and Phoebe e.g.) Can lead to \textit{Strategic Payoff} where the strategic nature of their thinking pays off and they’ve well forecasted the other’s choice.
		\item \textit{Dominant Strategy}: When there is one clear winner in the strategy you use. It takes the lead the majority or all of the time when put into the matrix. This is found through \textit{Best Response Analysis} which is found by going through each option of B and selecting the best strategy for A to choose (repeat for all columns of B). Then repeating for B (for all rows of A). The double underlined is the dominant strategy.
		\item \textit{Dominated Strategy}: When the strategy a player chooses is dominated than another strategy which would make you better-off than the one you’re choosing.
		\item \textit{Nash Equilibrium}: When there is a clear equilibrium between the players' \textit{Dominant Strategies}. Means you can't \textit{Unilaterally Deviate} to become more profitable (no incentive to deviate).
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textit{Unilateral Deviation}: When there is no dominant strategy.
			\item \textit{Mixed Strategies}: Players randomise strategies on unpredictable patterns (e.g. with muscular workouts).
			\item \textit{Pure Strategies}: When the player knows for sure what option they will choose.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item They collide and both marginally lose out
			\item One swerves and loses out bigger (chicken)

		\item Commitment to maintain high prices
		\item By committing to match low prices, A changes payoffs such that it’s not beneficial for B to undercut – as bigger payoff can’t be seen 
		\item Both firms end up paying high prices
		\item (Pricing) \textit{Prisoner’s Dilemma}
	\end{itemize}

	\newpage

	\subsection{Prisoner's Dilemma}

	\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item \textit{Cooperate} or \textit{Defect}
		\item Mutual gain: \textit{Cooperate}
		\item Individual incentive: \textit{Defect}
		\item \textit{Pareto Efficienct Equilibrium}
		\item Recall: someone has a dominant strategy where there’s harm done to each other and they could be better off (Pareto Efficient). Self-interest doesn’t pay off. But, games can be repeated (e.g. price re-setting), e.g. lower price than opponent now (get more custom volume), makes opponent less-off (also poor for aggregate prices), firms may form a passive collusion where they both think opponents will set low so they both set high
		\item Both players have dominant strategy to defect but they could have a better result when the both cooperate. Hence, when choosing best interest, harm is done to the opponent when choosing to Defect for own interest, the opponent may choose to Cooperate so have a worse outcome
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=5cm,height=2cm]{EC315-IMG/6.png}
	\end{center}

	Example:

	\begin{enumerate}
	\setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item (8,8) is Pareto Inefficient equilibrium as it is reached by both aiming for low by confessing. Could be made better off by both acting for mutual gain (3,3)
		\item Pricing – non-brand loyal market, flow freely between

		\item Team Work – (work vs shirk) shirk leads to more payoff as still full marks but no work done but if the other does all the work, they will get full marks but payoff will reduce due to workload
		\item Clean vs Dope – (risk based) best self-interest response is to dope as highest possible payoff but the equilibrium they both do it is less than the payoff if they both don’t
		\item Market Share – studying marketing is a waste of time. Market is a pie, we compete over our share. Ads try to [1] inform and [2] predatory (winning market share). Start: 50/50, engage in ads to win market share. I spend money, I get some in return but you won’t gain much more market share. The opponents do this to keep up. Each keep catching back up to 50\% each but both are still wasting millions on marketing. Market share isn’t changing proportionately but you’re still spending money
	\end{enumerate}

	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=3.5cm,height=4.5cm]{EC315-IMG/7.png}
	\end{center}

		\subsubsection{Externalities}

	\begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item \textit{Negative Externalities}: (own interest – doing too much) Cooperation reduces amount of work you do for the better (e.g. not over-fishing)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Don’t see costs from defecting – too much harmful activity is done
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textit{Positive Externalities}: (own interest – doing too little) Cooperation says you should do more work (e.g. not doing no work in a project)
		\begin{itemize}
                        \item Don’t see costs benefits form cooperating – too little of a good activity is done
                \end{itemize}
		\item Example: Marginal Benefit vs. Marginal Cost – (1) extracting fish from the ocean makes it harder in the future (e.g. do less fishing to allow repopulation). (2) But you want more to sell now. (3) Self-interest makes it harder for others
	\end{itemize}

		\subsubsection{Rationalise Cooperation Resolutions}

	\begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item Resolutions to \textit{Prisoner's Dilemma}
		\item Meet-up (verbal agreement): let’s set high prices (incentive of deception however – you want him to set high prices and you want to set low)
		\item \textit{Threaten}: punishment of opponent doesn’t set high prices (lacking credibility as you ``will do it'' rather than it ``will be done (automatically etc.)'' – can fix credibility by using Mafia as they have more incentive to harm him)
		\item \textit{Reward}: offer a reward that overcomes the incentive to defect (still lacks credibility as it involves giving money – lowers your payoff. May not even believe you)
	\end{itemize}

		\subsubsection{Behavioural Resolution}
	
	\begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item \textit{External Norms of Behaviour}: Think back to litter e.g.: many people won’t actually litter even though it’s the most beneficial for you. It conflicts with the social norm
		\item \textit{Internal Norms of Behaviour}: Doing nice things for people who are nice to you (gain utility). Being bad to people but they are good to you (loss of utility). - you defect but if you care enough, you’ll maybe rationalise cooperation and change mind
	\end{itemize}

		\subsubsection{Price Matching Guarantee Resolution}

	\begin{itemize}                                         
        \setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item You may be undercut for opponent to gain market share from you at lower prices
		\item If you’re offered. PMG, you will simply match prices and keep customers ``he’s selling at that price, can you just sell me at that too''
		\item Opponent now doesn’t gain, just sells at lower price as no market gain
		\item Equilibrium of both pricing high – out of Prisoner’s Dilemma
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=4cm,height=4cm]{EC315-IMG/10.png}
	\end{center}

		\subsubsection{Dynamic Punishment Resolution}

	\begin{itemize}                                         
        \setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item When defecting, a player may believe they will be ‘punished’ in the future
		\item Can we achieve cooperation through fear of punishment?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Credible: backed with fact
			\item Incredible: maybe won’t happen 
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textit{Finite Period} ($T$ Periods): defect in last period as no more time for retaliation
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Final period: mutual dominant strategy to defect as no future punishment 
			\item So: best to defect this period as well as you both will next
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textit{Infinite Period}: the game will continue [probability $p=1$] so retaliation 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Always an opportunity to punish as there’s always another period
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textit{Impatient}: future worth less than present so defect (not caring for punishment)
		\item \textit{Patient}: care more for future gain by waiting and cooperating
	\end{itemize}
		
		\paragraph{Discounting}

	\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item \pounds1 from \pounds1 today to \pounds1($1+r$) tomorrow; \pounds1 from \pounds1 tomorrow to \pounds$\frac{1}{(1+r)}$ today
		\item PV: $\frac{1}{(1+r)}$, $\frac{1}{(1+r)^2}$, ..., $\frac{1}{(1+r)^N}$; for discount rate $r$ and discount factor $\delta=\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$
		\item Hence, \pounds$X$ in period $t$ is worth \pounds$X\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$ today
		\item Hence, \pounds$X$ in period $t$ is worth \pounds$X\delta^t$ today
		\item $\delta$ close to 1: patient; $\delta$ close to 0: impatient
		\item CFs: $X_0,X_1,...,X_N$; PVs: $X_0+\delta X_1+\delta^2X_2+,...,+\delta^NX_N$
		\item Infinite: $1+\delta+\delta^2+\delta^3=\frac{1}{(1-\delta)}$

	\subsection{Games With Continuous Strategies}

	\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item This is applying maths to what we already know
		\item Nash equilibriums and sub-game perfect nash equilibriums remain the same
		\item This is applying the following more generally  
		\item Matrix strategy: can choose any option for the expected opponent’s options
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Simultaneous: best responses and mutually consistent best responses
			\item Sequential: backward induction 
		\end{itemize}
		\item Take a long time to analyse a continuous strategy using discrete sets (matrix)
	\end{itemize}

		\subsubsection{Quantity Competition}

	\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item In a \textit{Competitve Market}
		\item Firm $i$ supplies $q_i$ (where $\sum_{i=1}^Nq\ \forall i\{1,...,N\}$)
		\item \textit{Inverse Demand Function}: $p(Q)=a-bQ$
		\item Payoff is \textit{Profit} ($\pi_i$): $q_ip(Q)-C_i(q_i)$
		\item Hence: $\pi_i(q_{i=1},q_{i=2},...,q_N)=q_ip(Q)-C_i(q_i)$
		\item There is an \textit{Oligopoly} if several firms compete
		\item This method is shown in 1 to $N$ matrices for A to respond to B:
		\item 
			\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{ccc}
				\includegraphics[width=5cm,height=2cm]{EC315-IMG/12.png} & $\longrightarrow$ & \includegraphics[width=5cm,height=2cm]{EC315-IMG/13.png}\\
			\end{tabular}
			\end{center}
		\item Hence, we find a \textit{Payoff Function} which is maximised at a point; ``find the level of $q_1$ maximising firm A's payoff for given $q_2$''
	\end{itemize}

		\subsubsection{Continuous Strategies}

	\begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item Too hard to account for all the options (in this case quantities to produce)
		\item Recall basic math: \textit{Function}: the level; \textit{Derivative}: the slope of the function; \textit{Parital Derivative}: fix a variable
	\end{itemize}

		\paragraph{Rules of Differentiation}

	\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item Woring towards \textit{Payoff Function}
		\item Just like in the matrixes, fix the opponents option each time to find your best
		\item Hence, $y=f(x_1,x_2)$
		\item Fix $x_2$ (the adjacent firm's strategy) to observe how $x_1$ varies with $y$
		\item Therefore, partial derivative $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_1}$ for fixed $x_2$
		\item Thus, best response at $\{\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_1}|_{x_2}=0\}$ (peak of function)
		\item Note that, if you take the derivative on the incline of the function, you can be made better off by doing more. Take the derivative on the decline, better off by doing less
		\item \includegraphics[width=3.5cm,height=3cm]{EC315-IMG/14.png}
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}                              
        \setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item Recall the function $f(x)$:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $f'(x)$ positive at incline
			\item $f'(x)$ negative at decline
			\item $f'(x)=0$ at stationery point (max/min)
			\item \includegraphics[width=3.5cm,height=3cm]{EC315-IMG/15.png}
		\end{itemize}
		\item Recall if $f(x)=x^n$ then $f'(x)=nx^n-1$

		\subsubsection{Cournot Derivation of Payoff \& Reaction (Simultaneous)}
	
		\paragraph{Step 1}

	\textit{Fix firm 2's action and find firm 1's best response to it.}

	\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0cm}
		\item Find \textit{Payoff Function}
		\item Partially derive and $=0$ for \textit{Best Response} with fixed $q_2$
		\item Find best $q_1$ for \textit{Reaction Function}, sub for $q_1^*$
	\end{itemize}
		
		\paragraph{Step 2}

	\textit{Fix firm 1's action and find firm 1's best response to it.}

	\begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0cm}
                \item Find \textit{Payoff Function}
		\item Partially derive and $=0$ for \textit{Best Response} with fixed $q_1$
		\item Find best $q_2$ for \textit{Reaction Function}, sub for $q_2^*$
	\end{itemize}

		\paragraph{Step 3}

	\textit{Find meeting point of Nash Equilibrium where Reaction Functions meet; substitute to find optimal $\pi$ for each firm.}

		\paragraph{Definitions}

	\begin{itemize}                                                    
        \setlength\itemsep{0cm}                                            
                \item Players: 2 firms $i=1,2$
		\item Strategies: each firm chooses quantity of $q_i$, for $Q=q_1+q_2$
		\item Payoff: given supply choices \textit{Marginal Cost} of $c$, \textit{Price} of $P(q_1+q_2)$, \textit{Payoff} (profit) of $\pi_i(q_1,q_2)=q_1p(q_1+q_2)-cq_i$
	\end{itemize}

		\paragraph{Working Example}

	Firm 1's \textit{Payoff Function}: $\pi_1=q_1(a-b(q_1+q_2))-cq_1$\\
	$\pi_1=q_1(a-bq_1-bq_2)-cq_1$\\
	$\pi_i=aq_1-bq_1^2-bq_1q_2-cq_1$\\

	Fix $q_2$: $\frac{\partial\pi_1}{\partial q_1}=a-2bq_1-bq_2-c$\\
	$[a-2bq_1-bq_2-c=0]$\\
	$[2bq_1=a-c-bq_2]$\\

	Firm 1's \textit{Reaction Function}: $[q_1=\frac{a-c-bq_2}{2b}]...[q_1=\frac{a-c}{2b}-\frac{1}{2}q_2]$\\
	Recall: $q_1$ is not $(-)$ as $q_2\le\frac{a-c}{b}$\\

	Note that \textit{Reaction Function}: $q_1^*=\hat{q}_1(q_2)=\begin{Bmatrix}\frac{a-c}{2b}-\frac{1}{2}q_2\mathrm{if}q_2\le\frac{a-c}{b}\\0\mathrm{if}q_2>\frac{a-c}{b}\end{Bmatrix}$\\

	Hence, \textit{Reaction Function}: output quantity should decline as the opponent's increases; when it reaches 0, leave market; obviously no negative

	Firm 2's \textit{Payoff Function}: $\pi_2=q_2(a-b(q_1+q_2))-cq_2$\\
	Fix $q_1$: $\frac{\partial\pi_2}{\partial q_2}=a-2bq_2-bq_1-c$\\
	Firm 2's \textit{Reaction Function}: $[q_2=\frac{a-c-bq_1}{2b}]...[q_2=\frac{a-c}{2b}-\frac{1}{2}q_1]$\\

	Note that \textit{Reaction Function}: $q_2^*=\hat{q}_2(q_1)=\begin{Bmatrix}\frac{a-c}{2b}-\frac{1}{2}q_1\mathrm{if}q_2\le\frac{a-c}{b}\\0\mathrm{if}q_1>\frac{a-c}{b}\end{Bmatrix}$

                \includegraphics[width=3cm,height=3cm]{EC315-IMG/17.png}
        \end{center}

	\textit{Nash Equilibrium} (``The Courot Equilibrium''): flip firm 2's \textit{Reaction Function} and overlay\\
	Seek $q_1^*,q_2^*$ from $q_1^*=\hat{q}_1(q_2^*)$ and $q_2^*=\hat{q}_2(q_1^*)$\\
	``For firm 1's $q$ which maximises its $\pi$ given firm 2's $q$''\\
	``For firm 2's $q$ which maximises its $\pi$ given firm 1's $q$''

                \includegraphics[width=7cm,height=3cm]{EC315-IMG/18.png}
        \end{center}

	\textit{Substitution} is as follows:\\
	From $q_1=\frac{a-c}{2b}-\frac{1}{2}q_2$\\
	$q_1=\frac{a-c}{2b}-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{a-c}{2b}-\frac{1}{2}q_1)$\\
	$q_1=\frac{a-c}{2b}-\frac{a-c}{4b}+\frac{1}{4}q_1$\\
	$q_1=\frac{4b\left(a-c\right)-2b(a-c)}{8b^2}+\frac{1}{4}q_1$\\
	$q_1=\frac{2b\left(a-c\right)}{8b^2}+\frac{1}{4}q_1$\\
	$q_1=\frac{a-c}{4b}+\frac{1}{4}q_1$\\
	${\frac{3}{4}q}_1=\frac{a-c}{4b}$\\
	$q_1=\frac{4}{3}\frac{a-c}{4b}$\\
	$q_1=\frac{4(a-c)}{12b}$\\
	$q_1^*=\frac{a-c}{3b}$
	Sub for firm 2's $\pi$

	\textit{Cournot Equilibrium} is as follows:
	Hence: $Q^*=q_1^*+q_2^*$\\
	So: $p^*=a-bQ^*$\\
	Thus: $\pi^*=(p^*-c)Q^*$\\

	\fbox{$q_1^*=q_2^*=\frac{a-c}{3b}$; $Q^*=\frac{2(a-c)}{3b}$; $p^*=\frac{a+2c}{3}$; $\pi_i^*=\frac{(a-c)^2}{9b}$}\\

	Verify that:\\
	Industry output between monopoly and PC: $Q^M<Q^\ast+Q^C$\\
	Price between monopoly and PC: $p^M=p^\ast+p^C$\\
	Industry profit between monopoly and PC: $\pi^M>{\pi_1}^\ast+{\pi_2}^\ast>0$
