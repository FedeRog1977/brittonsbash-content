				<p>There are some moments that deserve the prolonged stare of admiration; those moments where you&rsquo;re lost in the view and Craig&rsquo;s rants of excitement about the Clachaig dinner later that day are nothing more than an ambient mumble blending into the atmosphere. Scotland has the potential to be one of the most stunning places on Earth given the right conditions and I&rsquo;ve been very lucky in 2021 to catch moments in these conditions more often than I could had hoped for. Despite my lack of decent enough equipment to even begin an attempt at doing these moments any justice, I still managed to capture some of the ones that meant most to me. This blog post isn&rsquo;t necessarily specific to hills but yes, all of the photographs here are likely to be of them. If you asked me a year ago what my &lsquo;finest moments&rsquo; were, I&rsquo;d probably say something like buying a 1986 IBM Model M or writing some shell script that opens the Vimtutor and doesnt let you close it until you&rsquo;ve completed it. Little did I know, a year later I&rsquo;d discover there&rsquo;s no feeling quite like the one you get at 1000m while watching an inversion roll down Starav gully, through the Glen, and all the way up to the Ben while the 6am warm summer sun rises over the Buachaille.</p>

				<h2>A Late Summer Cobble &#124; 08/09/2021</h2>

				<p>This was taken at the end of a solo route I did on one of the last good summer days of 2021. I was on the walk-out of a Narnain, &Igrave;me and Arthur loop when I stopped for a fill-up and saw how beautifully The Cobbler was catching the 5pm September sky. It was probably the only photo I didn&rsquo; go into the day expecting to get surprisingly, despite how popular the angle is. Everything about this picture made me realise just how underrated The Cobbler is amongst &lsquo;baggers&rsquo; and munro enthusiasts. I&rsquo;ve done it three times now and its versatility, terrain, views and picturesque nature never fail to impress.</p>

				<h2>Beinn an Lochain &#124; 28/08/2021</h2>

				<p>I had built this day up in my mind for so long that it definitely should not have been as special as it was but even then, it exceeded expectations. It was a special one for many reasons; I knew from the moment I heard Murray say it was his favourite hill that it would too be one of mine. But that&rsquo;s not all. There&rsquo;s something about Beinn an Lochain that I can&rsquo;t quite figure out. Even befre venturing up it, it just seemed like the perfect hill. You really get it all: magnificent views out to Jura and Mull; panoramics of the Cruachan range, the Lui range, the &lsquo;Larich hills, and even more southerly non-munros which are hard to find from other hills, if even visible at all. Also, views of two perfect inversion-ready valleys; a pleasant ridge; some scrably rock, spongey grass; some steeps, and some flats. Not to mention, this was the day I took my new baby (<a href="Allroad.html">Audi Allroad</a>) for its first outing with me behind the wheel, making it even more monumental. Yeah, Beinn an Lochain really is the perfect hill. All it&rsquo;s missing is the attention it deserves.</p>

				<p>I look like I&rsquo;m lost in thought in the first photo, contemplating all these things but, I&rsquo;m really not. The slow-rolling inversion truly captured me and I was fully fixed to watching its exit over the A83. The second photo captures a pretty iconic moment: Ben Lomond, Beinn Narnain and Ben Arthur all in one shot. These excellent hills define the start of the West Highlands. The thirst picture just.. is.. Beinn an Lochain. I mean literally, yes but also in so many more ways. It does such a great job of highlighting all the key features; the final push to the summit; it&rsquo;s well-defined ridge and subtly loud features.</p>

				<h2>The Playground &#124; 15/07/2021</h2>

				<p>First thing&rsquo;s first, this, I consider my greatest achievement to date. At 23.94 miles and 9,162 feet, this 13.5 hour day is by far one of the most glorious I&rsquo;ve ever experienced. It was part flex, part chad, and part <i>I&rsquo;ve just had my Covid vaccine and want to prove it doesn&rsquo;t effect me</i>. And of course also, I was recovering from a stupid flu that I got, probably from the 4 successive weeks of 3am starts at my wagey job and trying to fit Strathaven cycles in around this. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll stop complaining / trying to make you feel sympathy for me. This was a damn good day. The Arrochar Alps still get a bad rep&rsquo; amongst more serious enthusiasts or &lsquo;baggers&rsquo;. However, how could you possibly deny the beauty and versatility of the playground that is these six fantastic hills? Especially when they&rsquo;re basically in the back yard of the major western cities. The payoff for such a cheap day out is unmatched.</p>

				<p>The first photo really highlights the scale of The Playground. The photo is taken from the summit of Ben Vorlich and spans all the way across the Narnain ridge, Ben Arthur (The Cobbler), Beinn &Igrave;me, and Ben Vane. Although it felt like it took me half the walk just to get up Ben Vorlich at the end, it was fully worth it for this extremely rewarding shot. ...</p>
