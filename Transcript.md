# Option 1 - Consumer Engagement

## Problem

Sparse and untidy distribution of users across interactive platforms

*Energy customers aren't highly engaged app users, most customers use our digital services to check and pay their bills.*

## Task 

From desktop to mobile - condensation and generalization

*Propose an innovative way to increase customer engagement to increase regular usage of our digital apps.*

\newpage

# Relevant Mobile App Pages

*These will be referenced throughout this text. This list does not exhaust possibilities.*

1. Home (user summary)
2. Plan (unique user identifier)
3. Meter Readings (user input page)
4. Energy Usage (user output page)
5. Card Payment (finance)
6. Direct Debit (finance)

\newpage

# Demographic

*These will be referenced throughout this text. This list does not exhaust possibilities.*

1. First Timers
2. Transitioners
3. Loyalists

\newpage

# Motivating Factors in Mobile Apps

1. Convenience, Reliability & Trade-Off
2. Progress \& Competition
3. General \& Financial Safety
4. Slight of Hand

# Convenience, Reliability \& Trade-Off

## Problem

* Many *Transitioners* and *Loyalists* still view desktop as the most convenient and efficient method
* There may not be a great-enough gap between desktop and mobile UI functionality. For every loss of functionality on desktop, there should be an equal or greater gain on mobile
* Not too much of an issue for younger, *First Timer*, users as they will tend to prefer mobile accessability without persuation 

## Enhancements

* Mobile apps must utilize mobile-only features to create the illusion that mobiles are more convenient
*  For example, making the *Meter Readings* page more efficient by including Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology

<!--
ScottishPower is one of the classics. It has a long-term relaible reputation and can be known as one of the `safe' options in energy providers. At least to my knowledge. This means that a large portion of the demographic is composed of long-time loyalists and possible transitioners looking for a better deal. Because of the generational status of these users, they may have adapted to the desktop UI in recent years but are still reluctant to download apps as their PC is a more accessible device to them.

Sometimes there isn't enough of a gap between a desktop UI and a mobile app. That is, frequently you don't just need to make a mobile app better, you must unfortunately make a desktop UI worse. The idea is that, especially with the older segments of the demographic, you create the illusion that a mobile app is more functional first by making unique features available on them and then by making those features rely on things only a smartphone may be capable of. This makes it appear as though the smartphone is more `capable' and therefore, a more convenient method of transfering what's in a users mind to text. As a desktop user, this makes me sad to say as the keyboard is the most efficient way of navigating anything, but many firms now are simply removing features from desktop and making them only compatable with smartphone features.

Possibilities of this are quite expansive; one of which could be using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology for the meter readings page which allows the user to use a smartphone camera to take a picture of their readings in real life. This means users simply must check over inputted text, rather than inputting it themselves. This avoids the classic comments like ``my fingers are too big for that'' and other nonsence stemming from reluctance to use a mobile device, and theoretically should attract more from older generations. OCR would hold-up fine with the cylindrical tickers on meters.

As always, there is the extreme solution of making other interfaces so bad that users hate them. For example, a 10GB transparrent picture on the desktop site so it takes forever to load; removing website functionality all together; reducing functionality and options available with telephone and mail services; etc.

# Progress \& Competition 

## Problem

* People don't just want to see low prices, they want to see progressively greater value
* The *Energy Usage* page is a little simple; it relies on the user's own motivation
* This may not be stimulating enough to keep new users enticed
* The younger, perhaps *First Timer*, generation need competition to stimulate their prolonged interest

## Enhancements

* The *Energy Usage* could be extremely extensive and competitively stimulating and provide functionality to *Plan*
* A **'usage floor'** and a **'usage ceiling'** is a good starting place
* More precise analytics based on user definitions and **goals**
* Cross-user **competition** on costs and energy usage
* Compatability with a new **maps** feature
* Effective with whole demographic

<!--
The current energy usage page is good for giving an introductory overview of statistics but it's not enough to keep the user motivated and stimulated over time. They must not become bored of the app. People must see things changing over time (preogress), which creates the opportunity for competition between the user's self and others. The app has the ability to use many useful mobile features which require less effort from the user compared to a desktop method.

Note: For this section, note that <i> denotes floating time periods such as `hourly', `daily', `weekly', `monthly', `annually', etc.

A usage floor and a usage ceiling can be used to start by making users competative with themselves. They already have historical prices and and energy usage available to view but this only makes them normalize to the median, perhaps mean, value over time. Creating a usage floor based on parameters defined by the users in a new app page gives them a motivating number to float towards. Objective parameters may include [what they'd like to pay on an <i> basis]; [how many appliances they run]; [the type of appliance (requires in-app estimate data)]; [how long appliances are used on an <i> basis]; etc. This would involve greater rear-end data holding and math capabilities however, nothing outwith the resources and statistcial capabilities already utilized in this app. The range of output from calculations here show good benchmark values for how little energy a user could consumer (floor) and how much they could consume (ceiling). This gives not only a possible range of variation for peace of mind, and a motivation to stay low, but also, has the capability to produce cost floor/ceiling estimates for the more money-amount-inclined users. Of course, to my dislike, questions/prompts for input of these parameters can be worded less pragmatically and more `humanly' to create harmony with the user. For the ease of matching data, most options should be presented in a slection manner, like a drop-down list. As always, time-series progression should be displayed to the user to create ongoing motivation.

Based on quite extensive data collected by ScottishPower from external sources (in-app estimate data) and from the users themselves (as previously and subsequently listed), analytics can be produced to highlight to the user which appliances they could better-optimize; providing further (relative to those listed above) suggestions. This section creates more specific goals for the user to follow and optimize their behaviours relative to. Subjective parameters may include [how much a user feels they need certain appliances (i.e. a rating/ranking of appliance importance which highlights perhaps unecessary usage in unimportant areas)], [at what times they require appliances (i.e. is there a better / more efficient time on the local grid to use this appliance?)], [is an appliance dependent upon another? (i.e. link tree between a user's appliances - do things need to be on at the same time? <e.g. ``Turn <lamp> off, you don't need it while using <ThinkPad X220 w/ ThinkLight>!''>)]. The output from this operation can be presented on a new app segment/page and with the classic optional push notifications. Very simply, a status page may include progress bars showing progression towards usage/cost goals, perhaps on specific appliances. And, a notification may read ``use <j> application <k> less per <l> to reduce energy usage/cost by <x>''. Again, time-series progression should be displayed to the user for ongoing motivation.

On a more corss-sectional note, user data can be shared to compare across the platform. Of course this involves a lot of data protection verification and user permissions etc. however, can be very effective amongst users who like to be more efficient than others. Maybe that's just me, I don't know. For example, users could be compared over total energy usage and costs, or on segments perhaps sorted specific to [region (streets, council areas)], or [common appliance type]; for comparison of different stats and ratios such as [who the most efficient user is (average cost per appliance etc.)], [who the most efficient user of a specific appliance is], etc. This likely would encourage users to spend and consume more wisely, and making the app more enjoyable.

A map feature can be integrated as a way of displaying distribution and density of resultsto all segments discussed. Not only does this aid the competative nature, it can also assist users with more basic things like highlighting an area of energy efficiency when moving home etc. There is room for many layers on the map feature.

We can also note that many of these features have potential to interact with the plans page, to suggest optimal plans based on usage and cost-based calculated and defined by the user in this process.

These methods would be specifically effective with the energetic and frequently frightfully competative younger first timers, and even the overly-competative neighborhood da loyalists.

# General \& Financial Safety

## Problem

* There may be concern over entry to the app as it does contain 'private' informaiton
* The *Card Payment* and *Direct Debit* pages may be 'scary' to older generations

## Enhancements

* Facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, 2/3-factor authentication, dynamic passwords (OTP) (some of these may compromise convenience/efficicency)
* Monero (XMR), Neo (NEO), etc. accessability and interactivity for privacy

<!--
There may be concern regarding the security of entering the app. Of course, there's a variety of private data in use on the app, including banking details and of course any generation does not want this to be compromised. Additonally, especially regarding older generations, the card payment and direct debit pages may be scary to some. There are still individuals who hesitate over giving email addresses, never mind bank details, on a digital platform. Sadly some of these people will never be swayed unless they are guaranteed absolute certainty of privacy and safety.

Computational solutions to these problems are simple, it's gaining the trust of individuals which is the hard part. Especially when people don't understand the solutions. Generally, if a large and trustworthy firm such as ScottishPower assures someone of safety, they won't refrain from engagement.

Making it exceptionally hard to enter the app if you're not the user but exceptionally easy if you are can be tricky. Components must align perfectly; records must match and therefore be stored, which there is of course a safety concern over. I mean, it's up to you to decide if multiple bodies having access to your fingerprint and portrait is actually `safe' but, as long as people think it is and it's properly regulated by ScottishPower, users should be happy. There is no doubt that dynamic passwords (One Time Passwords (OTP)) are the safest as they are random, unique, varying and disconnected from the user. Users today don't mind trading off the time taken to recieve an OTP for the added safety. A two or three factor combination of authentication would work best; allowing the user to define their own degrees of security preferences of course. For example, open app, scan finger, recieve text with OTP, enter OTP. 

Finally, Monero payments should be normalized and mainstreamed. It is the only cryptocurrency which is actually fully private, encrypted and decentralized. Unlike the Bitcoin and DogeCoin nonsence, and every other ElonMuskCoin meme. Integrating payment by Monero in the app and using Monero wallets on either side of the transaction is likely the safest way to transact in the current day as there is very little risk of user association and theft. Therefore, giving older generations or perhaps naive individuals more assurance of security.

# Slight of Hand

## Problem

* Users can become bored and frustrated through repetative and tedious navigation
* Modern-day users especially aim to be able to interface with closed eyes, in an 'ideal' world

## Enhancements

* User customization of UI to allow muscle memory and comfort/familiarity of thier preference
* Allow users to create custom macros using dynamic gesture technology

<!--
Users can become bored and frustrated through repetative and tedious navigation leading to premature exit from the app and lack of inclination to use. Modern-day users aim to be able to interface with closed eyes, in an `ideal' world so it's important to give them a way to make features usable as quick as possible, suject to their abilities and preferences.

Allowing users to fully customize the UI (layout, transitions, color scheme, etc.) can make them feel more familiar with the app and allow them to be more `snappy' through their full processes. It's also a good idea to allow users to create their own macros using recent developments in Android and Apple's dynamic gesturing. This would allow users to become familiar with their own gestures which they may already use elsewhere; letting them become used to the interface faster and making recurring accesssability more efficient. This of course relies heavily on compatability with these, very recent and incomplete, external technologies of a devices (which can vary in age, stage in life and functionality which may potentially lead to in-app issues). But, as these become closer to reality, they should be implemented. The customization features also have to potential to sell further to the younger generations, creating the illusion of something more `personal' in an era where it's fashionable to be as `unique' as possible.
