  "description": "An excellers first bag of the A82 to Glinners in the ALL. Sleep in the OG car camp spot next to the Clachers. Yeah, it was an M&S meal deehul and bed at 8pm. Saturday was supposed to be Schoolhouse redemption. Weather was perfect and very encouraging however, the mix of 0 tread and greasy rock didn't let me get the satisfaction I wanted. Unfortunately it was a return to ground level once again. Ideally should have done plan B which was Bidean again for the inversion. Instead I just observed the inversion under Bidean from Schoolers. Good day tho. Finally back to the summrhse asfterwards too. And a very interesting one with Mr. J.C. To say the least.",
