\section{Core Task: Heuristic Evaluation}

	\subsection{Basics}

	As an alternative to empirical, formal and automated methodologies where people or a series of pre-defined simulations test software throughout various stages and levels of relevance in the design process; Nielsen (1994) proposes a critique-based heuristic evaluation method which involves feedback relative to particular areas of expertise. Niesel finds that this approach is effective before user testing, as minor issues should not be allocated space or time in user testing; before redesign, as relevant subjective opinion may skew in a direction not necessarily followed initially; when you're aware of issues however desire assurance so time is not wasted on them; and, pre-final release for the final polish.\\

	Nielsen also claims that the optimal number of `experts' assigned to an evaluation is three to five, in order to find the optimal number of problems relative to the cost-benefit analysis. In this case however, of course only one is being used as the problem sample is likely to be extremely small. Each problem should be listed indivdually and marked against the set of ten heuristic factors and a severity rating, as seen in Table 1.1. There should be two or three passes upon each problem.\\

	\subsection{Analysis}

	\begin{longtable}{p{7.5cm}p{0.5cm}p{0.5cm}p{4cm}}
		\textsc{Description} & \textsc{Vio.} & \textsc{Sev.} & \textsc{Proposed Solution}\\
		\hline
		\textbf{Location}:\newline Adding a personal circumstances report is a very common protocol amongst students, from my experience. Although I've never completed one myself, at least (approx.) 30\% of students I've known have. Therefore, that makes this feature just as relevant as something like booking a library room, for example. Which is a prominant feature. This feature should be just as accessible. & $\mathrm{H_{7}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Create major link as opposed to hierarchical path.\\
		\textbf{Spacing}:\newline Major heading on the primary form page has inconsistent spacing (margins/ local padding) which is too small and looks improper against the consistently high line height throughout the form. & $\mathrm{H_{4}}$, $\mathrm{H_{8}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{1}}$ & Increase heading margin.\\
		\textbf{Scaling}:\newline Page does not scale well to medium--small device widths. This means elements are lost and unreadable & $\mathrm{H_{8}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{1}}$ & Correct style scaling to scale below 300\%.\\
		\textbf{Gutters}:\newline White space gutters in main text body division appear too narrow and therefore make long strings of text harder to read. This also makes elements such as the text input box appear to wide. & $\mathrm{H_{8}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{1}}$ & Increase gutters by approximately 5\%\\
		\textbf{Date Input Boxes}:\newline Input boxes for `first date of circumstance' and `last date of circumstance' are of \verb|text| type and therefore there is a greyscale prompt posted above the input boxes to encourage the user to follow a particular format, which is just awkward as users must enter a series of special characters in particular places. & $\mathrm{H_{7}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Change the input type of the input boxes to date so there is always the correctly defined input format, and remove the greyscale prompt.\\
		\textbf{Date Select}:\newline Next to the input boxes for the discussed dates, are optional date select features which allow the user to find dates using a calendar system. These features open in a new browser window. This may be an issue where certain user browser preferences may block features such as links opening new windows, etc. The user may also be left unaware of what the issue is if the new window does not open as there is no protocol in place to inform them. & $\mathrm{H_{3}}$, $\mathrm{H_{4}}$, $\mathrm{H_{5}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & By inlcluding these date select features as a drop-down or pop-up overlay would reduce browser associated issues. Further, removing the feature all-together may be more effective in reducing bloat, if the previously discussed amendments to the date input boxes are implemented.\\
		\textbf{Date Select Window}:\newline The graphic design/styling of the new window displaying the date select calendar is completely inconsistent with the primary Pegasus stylesheet. This isn't really a big issue as your just selecting three things however, for the sake of consistency and continuity, this is inappropriate. & $\mathrm{H_{4}}$, $\mathrm{H_{8}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Amend, for consistency: colors: spacing, font, font-decoration, margin and padding standards, table borders, to name a few.\\
		\textbf{Description Input Box}:\newline The description input box has an infinite character limit but a text prompt and subsequent example encouraging the user to keep their text brief. This is bloated and ineffective as the user is still free to abuse the input box. Additionally, the prompt and example take up space with, effectively irrelevant, content which can be replaced with additional minor functionality features. & $\mathrm{H_{1}}$ (Space), $\mathrm{H_{7}}$, $\mathrm{H_{8}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Include a word limit and placeholder which restricts and prompts the user to keep their text brief in a more effective manner.\\
		\textbf{Edit Practicality}:\newline If a user wishes to alter an existing personal circumstances request, they are prompted to enter their active requests, delete the one with an error and create a new one in its place. This is unecessarily time consuming for the user. & $\mathrm{H_{5}}$, $\mathrm{H_{7}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Add a feature which allows users to edit the 3 input elements (start date, end date and description) of their existing requests.\\
		\textbf{Session Time-Out}:\newline A more general issue with Pegasus; there is no prompt to allow the user to choose between extending their session or logging out if they've been idle for too long. Instead, when you attempt to use a function on the page, you are notified that your session has timed out and you're returned to the login page. & $\mathrm{H_{1}}$ (Change), $\mathrm{H_{7}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Either: introduce a pop-up (or something of the sort) prompt when a user has been idle too long, requesting that they either extend their session or log-out. Or when the session times out, instead of landing the user at the homepage after re-log-in, take them to thir last page accessed.\\
		\textbf{Completion Notification}:\newline Once a request is complete, there is no notification to inform the user that thier request has been successfully submitted. The user is just redirected to the home page. This may lead to confusion as the user must manually check against their records to ensure their most recent request has been submitted. If there are multiple requests, this may become awkward and more time consuming than is necessary. & $\mathrm{H_{1}}$ (Next Steps / Completion) & $\mathrm{S_{2}}$ & Include a noticiation of success (pop-pup overlay, new page, redirect to relevant page, etc.)if the request has been successfully. Or, a notification of failure , including a reason and redirection to a relevant page, if the request has not been successfully submitted. \\
		\textbf{Viewing Existing Enries}:\newline On the table of existing personal circumstances requests, the link to open the request details is broken (although working in the demonstration video provided under identical circumstances). The link highlighted on the titles of created circumstance requests simply leads to the current page thus, in effect, `refreshing' the page. Therefore, features such as the option to delete an entry or edit an entry are unavailable. As this is the only way to access them, it makes these required features completely unusable in cases where they may be necessary. & $\mathrm{H_{3}}$, $\mathrm{H_{7}}$ & $\mathrm{S_{3}}$ & Correct link/path. \\

\section{Medium Fidelity Prototype}

	This medium fidelity prototype developed for this project makes use of HTML, CSS and JavaScirpt in order to deliver a basically functioning user interface which responds in a way which would be reflected by the final application. However, it doesn't relay or fetch any database data. Data used in this example comes from basic HTML and JavaScript generations. Note that screenshots may be skewed / out of proportion as they are scaled to fit in equal rows and columns in a nice, neat \LaTeX\ table. For the sake of continuity and clarity, all use cases are presented here, not just three.
