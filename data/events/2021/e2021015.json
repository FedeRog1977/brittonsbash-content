  "description": "The birth of ultimate functionality. The birth of sushware. The birth of successful wasted. This was a trip of unexpected pleasures. We pulled up at some overflow car park in the glen just next to the turn-off for the Clachaig. It was the first sushi dinner, with a selection of katsu and salmon rolls I'd picked up from the one, the only (M&S) earlier. Then it was onto the Clachaig for our first impromptu wasted on the fine ales of the west highlands. We teased the end of the night with a short round of the first 20 or so meters of Oontag Etag then a couple' bags of Percy Pigs. Griff could't be bothered pitching his toynt so the ultimate functionality of trunk-bunk sleeping came into play for the first time. The hill day was a success to some degree. Naive, inexperienced me chickened out at the scrambling however, I wasn' disappointed. Probably because I ended up having an exhilarating hour's worth of hill briefing with the finest Stirling trad braided brunette, wide brown-eyed, flat-chested, wide-hipped, five-foot-four-inch, 7% body fat, well-spoken, leg-covering, Patagonia-wearing, Scarpa trotting, Walkhighlands wielding, soycial media-avoiding, Clubmaster-rocking, fingernail-biting, make-up-averse wife material on my descent. Anyway, that's about it. Deck chairs and coffee at Co-op Ballachullish and an enduring Ben Vorlich to split up the drive home. Well, Ben Vorlich trig. We sort of missed the summit by accident. But that's okay, it just means there must be a future return to the playground.",
