  "description": "First real experience in the ooah clag clug for the day. Wrong turn to start the proj saw us take a very interesting d'tour across an excellent fort of bogs towards, what we didn't realise was, a corbett. Of course we turned back towards the `ros and kicked ourselves later when we found out. Anyway, excellent incline to Beinn Numer One then it was just turn the diesel on from there. I wasn't that familiar with the Lawers range at the time to I had no clue that, because we weren't dong the Lawers seven, just the ones the Griff had missed last time he was in the round, he made me miss Lawers by about 500ft from Beinn Ghlas. Let's not get hung up on that anyway.",
