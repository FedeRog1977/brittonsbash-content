  "description": "As those select few know, this is probably the most important day of my 2021 and my most monumental achievement to its date. We all know about my two failed attempts on Ben Lui, laughable. ``Dude you're a bloody embarrassment''. But a few weeks later something clicked. Two of my friends were talking about going out to send the Lui Four and I'm not sure if it was jealousy of ability and being considered one of those incapable or, just simply that I was so anxious to prove to myself that I could do it but, it was in that moment that I drunkenly decided to book my second ticket to Tyndrum for one more attempt. Just in the passing of these few weeks though, my attitude changed. I'd felt a different kind of connection to hills and why people want to escape to them. I began to appreciate the freedom and happiness it can bring, instead of ticks on a 2007 website. So, I studied up on the literature, videos, and started to autistically learn all the hill and route beta because this time it actually excited me, it wasn't just a task. I made my appearance in Tyndrum the following week and sent the Lui four. From then on, it was a summer of solo project, followed by solo project, followed by weekend duo project. Repeat until death.",
