  "description": "Pretty damn good one this year. Started it off with the classic Die Hard sesh at Paul's on Christmas Eve to get in the festive spirit, then returned home for a safe and conservative 3am to be up and fresh the next morning for the big day. Started the 25th with some Spider-Man 3 and a breakfast of porridge with Lindor, Terrance Montgomergy's Chocolate Orange, and fruit jellies, as tradition requires. After wrapping some sausages and part-boiling some vegetables, I thought it'd be appropriate to take a short run in anticipation of the incoming Carbsmas. I started cooking at around 4pm over a port, a sherry, a whisky, some Friends, and the classic Christmas not-a-Christmas-film film Shrek Forever After. Boxing day was pretty much the same, after a Waterfoot loop with Mark, its was back on the cheese, port and a good five hours of Lily Collins while constructing the Lego 1985 quattro Sport.",
