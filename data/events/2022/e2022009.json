  "description": "An excellent start to the proper sized projects for the year. Clocking in at just over 18 miles, it felt good to once again feel that burn of supreme depression but ultimate pride. Of course the proj' started off in the classic fashion with suhware and elderflower in the back of the five over the feature length pilot of suits. Then a broken four hours of sleep at minus five degrees. The route sort of split into three different experiences, there was a bit of everything. The six mile walk-in with completely clear skies and teasing views of Ben Oolium kicked it into gear. Then, a steep push straight up to Creag Mhòr with doubts we would be able to summit in the ice. However after growing up and accepting the possibility of the k, it was a stunning mountaineering session. Ice axe and micros out and a lovely traverse across the Fort of Bogs. Even if the descent did coin a typical depressing bog fest.",
