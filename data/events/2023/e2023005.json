  "description": "This was the first sign not to take Ross on hill projects, but he was just teasing us in at this point. We had an awkward dinner, in Ross' opinion, which was made by Davey and enchanced with beer. We then headed out for a big ol' night on the Inverness town. This was goddamn dull. Music was quite good but bars were boring as hell. I cut off early and went to bed, but was then, actually to my delight, woken up by a shhteamin' and kebab-filled Ross and Craig at about 1am, who challnged me to down the rest of the whisky. I did. This led to some excellent waterfighting and bed flipping. By the way, it was CG's first time back on the drink since December, so messy he was. We probably got to bed around 3am, and it was one of those mornings I woke up thinking I'd only had a blink of sleep. It was 7am and Ross' was ready to get rocking and rolling though. RIP. We cooked up a totally unnecessary Simon Howie spread and got off to the Munro half way between Inverness and Ullapool. Despite the stunning weather, the river crossing only a few miles in broke us and it was soon off to Ullapool for a coffee. Yeah, a lot of miles for nowt. We still managed to make it to Roon's for the bash though. This was a bit of a slog given out conditions.",
