  "description": "We promised ourselves we would never let the Mullardoch Effect get to us again. We broke our promise. After a slightly... restless, shall we say... night in Inverness Youth Hostel, we hoped the Dearg Four would liven up our days. Upon approach to the first Munro however, we discovered how wrong we were to hope for that. It was four Munros worth of relentless 70mph gusts; horizontal snow, hail, and rain; annoyingly not-deep-enough and not-shallow-enough snow; and lacking ski goggles. There was a lot of struggle, a lot of pain, and even an end in tears. As always though; worth it. Although we didn't have time for the planned beef stew in Aviemore afterwards, we still made the-hell the most of it with some venison burgers and a fantastic f*ck-up at the portable desk, in the dining room of the Glenmore hostel. Sunday was nothing more than a routine trip to a cafe, and tour of the outdoor shops. Actually met Culshie Eli too, which was a rather unexpected delight.",
