  "description": "It was time for the ALL to take to some roads it was designed for. Or at least Audi claim. We ran the classic steak and reduced Morrisons Fort Bill potatoes on the Firday, and I did develop a good hack to revive the potatoes, at last. Next morning was a great blue bird photo opportunity for the ALL along the ALLroad. This is one of many projects that highlight why March-April-May are the best project months. Just the perfect amount of snow to make the, already fairly easy, project doable, and the perfect amount of sunshine. The wak-in was a little boring but it's always part of the excitement. The reason we weren't doing all four of the Munros on-route was because we had the Admiral closing party to get to for our 7pm rezzie. But yeah, that went to hell when they said they weren't serving food. Back to Griff's for an 800 and debrief it was.",
