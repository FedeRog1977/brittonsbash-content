			<h2>University Summary</h2>
	
				<p>
					As of summer 2020, I have completed my third year of university study in Bachelors level Finance & Economics. I have achieved distinction in my third year results. In first year, my broad studies included additional subjects such as Business Law, Business Analysis & Technology, Management, Marketing and Algebra & Calculus. Next year, honours year, I plan to take purely take forward Finance in the form of Asset Pricing, Quantitative Methodology, International Financial Management and Advanced Corporate Finance. For each relevant class, I have constructed course summaries of which PDFs are linked below, for your leisure. I enjoy standardisation and have OCD so boom! There's your course summaries 'troops'!   
				</p>
	
			<h3>Corporate Financial Markets</h3>
	
				<p>
					The class from second year (AG215) expanded knowledge and understanding of topics including capital budgeting, capital depreciation, leasing, inventory optimisation, and corporate risk. The third year class (AG312) focused on deeper explorations of asset backed securities, real options - extending to the Black & Scholes model, and international financial management. These classes involved an Excel and Visual Basic-based capital budgeting project and a written project based on the 2008 financial crisis, focusing on mortgage-backed securities. Both are listed and linked under the relative headings below.

			<h3>Portfolio/Security Analysis & Derivatives</h3>

				<p>
					The second year class (AG217) in this field focused on portfolio management and security analysis, extending to mean variance analysis, Sharpe testing, general asset pricing, bond pricing, in order to optimise a portfolio. Market efficiency and fund performance analysis further expanded understanding of investment strategies, giving an empirical analysis of markets. The relative third year class (AG313) in this area focused on international risk and exchange and options and futures derivative pricing. These classes involved a MATLAB-based portfolio optimisation project and a written international exchange risk project.

			<h3>Microeconomics</h3>

				<p>
					Second year microeconomics (EC215) introduced budget constraints, preferences, cost minimisation, profit maximisation, advanced algebra and calculus, supply, demand, technology and monopoly/oligopoly operations. The third year expansion of this class (EC315) dialed in on more specific topics such as game theory - exploring dominating corporate strategies and further profit optimisation. Further, topics in public economics included equity distribution, commodity tax, cost benefit analysis, fiscal federalism, programme/policy analysis and crime and punishment. This class involved a Gretl project exploring the cross-sectional econometric regregression portion of this class.

			<h3>Macroeconomics</h3>

				<p>
					The second year class of this variety (EC216) introduced the model of consumption and GDP including labour models and monetary and fiscal policy. The class gave a brief introduction to econometric statistics and data analysis. This gave an introductory understanding of manual regression analysis and interpretation. The third year class (EC316) expanded upon these theories and analyses - exploring economic growth, saving, capital & output, technological progress, expectations and investment/consumption, econometric GARCH models, time-series correlation, cointegration and error correction. The econometric portion was again executed through the C-based statistical analysis UI, Gretl.

This project may have two other names on it but it's no secret tht I did it all myself.

			<h3>Statistical Regression Analysis in Gretl | Economics EC315 2019</h3>

				<p>
					This project explored regressing sample data against a possible explanatory variable. Descriptive analysis was first conducted on the sample data, followed by hypothesis testing, and model integrity testing. Again, this appears as a group project however, I did all of the Gretl work, analysis, and presentation script writing myself.

			<h2>University Roles</h2>

			<h3>Student Ambassador</h3>			

				<p>
					In 2019 I wanted to expand my reach in my university and dig deeper into their operations. I did this by electing myself to take part in the Open Days as a temporary Student Ambassador. This subsequently led to me becoming a permanent Student Ambassador, with responsibilities such as touring, giving talks, organising university events, and all things alike. I will hold this role until graduation.  
				</p>

			<h3>Widening Access Team</h3>
			
				<p>
					In 2019 I also joined the Strathclyde Widening Access Team who aim to extend the reach of the university's admissions and encourage lower income, lower progression rate schools to accelerate their efforts in school in order to progress to university. This scheme exists to positively effect the university's image and reputation, and has done a reasonably good job of this in previous years. In 2019/2020 I was head of logistics and had a large influence in other aspects of the One Step Forward Event which was an event aimed at bringing low progression rate schools' students to the university and give them an enhanced introductory view of what could be theirs; in anticipation of this setting of a spark in them leading to their potential accelerated effort and grades. This event was planned to 100% with myself and others acquiring sponsors and visitors such as Ernst & Young and bodies alike. The event was never executed however die to COVID-19.
