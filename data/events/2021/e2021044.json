  "description": "Ahh what a good one. First send with Oxy on board, had no idea what I was in for. The drinking started early in the FIVE on the drive-in but I wasn't complaining, we had plenty-a-crate to work out way through. Stuck to the traditional loaf on the drive-in too, before the M&S roast beef in the Aviemore Youth Hostel. We worked our way through about half a crate each then headed boys én tourè to Mambo's, where Griff and I spent the evening sparking some questionable debates in the SUMC chat. They headed to whatever that Aviemore nightclub is called but of course I did a Lewis and just went back to the hostel and solo'd a few' in an arm chair. This was the least messy of the nights. We were all still a little tender the next day however, and so saw the birth of the Aviemore care home. Lorne and trop down and off Murk and I went for an attempted walk around Loch Morlich. We only made it through the front door of the Pine Marten though. Couple coffees and the worst chips of our lives later, we attempted the walk-out. Oxy and the Griff had to rescue us in the FIVE on their abseiling drive-out however. Good Thai curry sobered us up right good after that. Gained me the title of the `Highland chef' from Oxy. Anyway, after that it was straight back on the crates and `Lewis measure' drams. That's like a 300ml glass. Got us a good three bottles down between four people in no time. They headed back out to the nightclub after that. Who knows what I did. Give them the room key certainly wansn't something I did. Woke up to smashed-up tube, cans, toilet paper and a wet flare sign the next morning so must have been a good one. Wee Route 7 Cafe sorted us out the next morning. Drive-out was very questionable. Griff didn't speak a word.",
