  "description": "Two weeks off is too much, although a five-setter is still a very satisfying way to spend a Saturday too. Anyway, back on the A9 for Glen Spean and the Creag Meagaidh round of three. Stopped in Atholl for a Bothy Bar `ll `rms nachos then fish and chops for diesel on the Friday night to break up the rodeo. Then The Maze in the back of the FIVE. Routine say on Saturday followed by a long-awaited return to Saturday summr'hse.",
