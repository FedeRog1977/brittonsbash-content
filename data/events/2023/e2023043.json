  "description": "This was possibly the most minimalist solo holiday I rocked this year. Although it did feel like a very suitable end to the solo season, and it certainly did not have a very PG13 beginning. In fact we could say this hol-e-day started in the OP with PMB, McN, and CG. What a spread, and a start to a great tradition. I don't really remember much but it was pretty much a very short perpendicular trip to bed followed by a difficult effort to the bus station to make the Edinburgh flight to the minute. I arrived in once piece though, and it was stright out to the streets to map out my running route and get some street beers. And of course map out the best grocery store bakeries for the morning. The first full day, as it usually is anywhere I solo (before the storm), was the most functional. It started with a nice clean and fairly fast introduction to street running, some bakery breakfast, then onto the days explorations. Some very fine locations were hit this day, indeed. With the best of course being WMF. Had a nice dinner in the Bavaria Brauhaus of Hamburg and a very pleasant long walk back to the DEGENERATOR via a pit stop for Desperados Mojito. Sadly I sobered up quite a bit on the way home and managed to get up for another run the next day. Even if it was broken up by a slightly worrying tailbone injury. It was a slow stroll north on this rainy day to see the suburbs. Nice, but basically just Cheshire to be honest. I did stop for some absolutely stunning Poke though. As stunning as throwing some raw ingredients in a bowl can be, that is. It was also a great, unexpected, opportunity to listen to the Dire Straits Live 1978-1992 drop that had just taken the world by storm. I also finally saw the Hamburg tennis stadium irl. Was just as good as it was in Top Spin 3. Also got a hamburger for dinner when I got back to town this night to keep Alvaro happy. The last day was another brief stroll, some bakeries, and off home. Stunning walk-in to the airport actually. And very nice airport. But always good to be back in Her Majesty's Kingdom.",
