  "description": "A stunning (darling) Saturday morning called for a proj. I was gonna go meet Crug and Tulla for Gulvain but they claimed they were starting at 7:30 so would have been a 4'er for me. Of course they ended up starting at 11 though, so yeah. Anyway I finally took to Vorly II and Stucc Tae Ma Groin Mish in Loch Earn. Long awaited proj. Was scenic but far too busy with bams on the Vorlich summit. I did enjoy their My Way choir however. The proj was followed by another runner at Max's.",
