  "description": "An interesting one, finally seeing the birth of a new meme.. tea. Of course, the weekend was started with the traditional seeing off of a loaf in the back of the FIVE and some whisky chocolate liqueurs. Well done Oxy, good find. This time, from Murray's famous Perth Tesco. Many a beer had already been deleted upon arrival and to be honest, it was a blur from then to 4am. I removed 4l of Aviemore's finest water from existence before bed so obviously I was fine for a 9am wake-up and promptly obliterated some lorne, ran a run and helped the mighty Hamish clean up the embarrassment in the care home. When the rest finally dragged themselves up at 2pm, it was off to Loch Morlich for a 20 meter walk then back to the currum for Jile, Skyfall and tea. And, just a little rum and trop. Back when we were drinkers, this would have been laughable however now that we are seasoned tea enthusiasts, we sought continuation of the warm embrace of a council brew in a trip to The House of Bruar and Hettie's Tea Rooms, Pitlochry to break up the Sunday drive home.",
