  "description": "It was another Sunday proj this time, once again due to a necessary wasted. Great desk this Friday night, with a great all-meat stinky's pizza to top it off. It was a black-out one, they're always great. Anyway, up it was to almost the same car park as the previous week, to hit the most westerly Mamores. It was maybe gonna be the Ring Of Steall but the wind was not looking too inviting. After a slightly broken night of sleep and some meetings with the river, shall we say, the decision to stick to the easy route for the day ended up paying off. Although not a very scenic one initially, all it took was one hot mom to change that. It's a tough sell getting someone to change their mind about abandoning their route after a sketchy downclimb, but I worked my magic. Cutting past some seriously phenomenal firing-in, it was onto the routine M&S Fort Bill hit (there was none of the new breakfast smoothies on the shelf this time, RIP), then off home for a venison ragu and a bottle of Brodeaux.",
