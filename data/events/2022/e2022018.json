  "description": "A weekend trip to Glenfinnan and Mallaig. Started with a can on the A82 followed by an emergency pit stop for another can at the Green Welly Stop. Then it was onto Morrisons Fort Bill for more cans and a double-down on Pringles and Manomasas. We pitched in the car park for the round and fired up the BBQ for the second double-down on the M&S 3 for £10 meat deal. It was McNeilerAwazFM and myself in the back of the FIVE this time, put to sleep by some Wojak. Saturday's project was good. Back on the trend of long walk-ins but it was good to hit a couple' `ros and Corbett tops. Shoutout to Sheena in Mallaig, accomodation is luxurious. Sunday was a slow day after a night in the Steam Inn (yes, the steamin' mish) so no Beinn Guylian Chocolatier, but a stop in an Arisaig café and the Nevis Centre Fort Bill for lunch.",
