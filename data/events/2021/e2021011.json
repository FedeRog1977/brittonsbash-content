  "description": "Following the century; continuing the trend of `I've just spent a weekend in Manchester and desperately need an inappropriate amount of activity', I finally took to the field of The Playground, intending to hit up the round of four munros. It was a perfect day, still in the 25-30° period but of course I was wearing black gloves and a buff to cover up my sun burn from the day before. It was another monumental day, seeing my longest project to date and the birth of the A82 run-out from the Ben Vorlich road. Sadly I didn't hit Vorlich though because of, you guessed it, train times. However, the 3 mile run across the A82 and adjacent beach certainly made for the equivalent of another munro. For other Wojak reasons, this day was slightly monumental in another way. I mean, not in any way which lives up to the project itself but certainly in satisfaction of my controysoytion to soyciety and my footure. I got the call half way Beinn Ìme from ScoyttishSoyer to tell me I'd been accepted on the scholarship. That is, I wouldn't be paying the eight large for my upcoming Strathbloat course. This was quite funny considering just the day before, while on the century, I got the call from my new wagey boss to tell me I got the job I applied for there.",
