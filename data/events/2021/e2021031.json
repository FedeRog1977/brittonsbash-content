  "description": "The plan for this one was to add two new things into one of my favourtie routes. Surprisingly, I'd never actually been to the Narnain trig so the plan was to take the trad Narnain path from the A83 which crosses over the trig and all three cairns. Then, to drop down the Ben Arthur (The Cobbler) via the tourist staircase and follow the usual route on to Beinn Ìme. After this, I'd drop form Beinn Ìme to Beinn Luibhean, the corbett to the south west of it then do an A83 walk-out. All went to plan until I saw how disgusting the traverse looked; lose all your height, followed by fort of bogs, followed by fort of bogs vertical edition. So, I just came back down the tourist path and forestry commission access. Great day still, highs of 34° and a stunning coffee at Slanj.",
