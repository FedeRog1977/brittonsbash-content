My first attempt on Lui in April was only my third hike of the year which was still long before I had any real clue what I was doing. I mean, I couldn't even tell the hill hottee we met on the walk-out the name of the hill. How embarassing! Anyway, I failed the first attempt because I started pooping my pants on a snow cornice about 100m from the top and it took me about 20 minutes to compose myself and slide back down.",
