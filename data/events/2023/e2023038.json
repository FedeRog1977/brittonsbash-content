  "description": "Back on't' road again with McN in the stallion. Not only was it McN's first bag of Inverness youth hostel, it was a double-down of two of the GoATs: Inverness and Aviemore. It was a bit of a restrained waste on Friday night. I think we were both up for it but we knew we had to make the cottage at the entrance to the Munros before the OAP pulled the shotgun out. So it was only a cherry beer and couple Discos for me. Bright and fresh in the morn to be speed-warned by the OAP and rock some excellent name-on-the-register beta at the hills. Was again a very routine round. Not in my finest condition after Paris and a week off the roadie, but still got through on drop mode. even got a ride out from the rich-looking Salewa dood with the two-tone backpack and 2023 Defender. Anyway, onto the good stuff. Over to M&S Aviemore for dindins, quick stop for the rum and off to waste. Yet another successful one in the care home. We were actually back in the famous, cursed 2021 new year room. Sunday was, of course, a very slow one after the beers and 70cl, but that's cool, got a new Buff from Cairngorm Outdoors. Success.",
