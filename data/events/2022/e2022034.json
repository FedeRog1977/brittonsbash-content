  "description": "Back to the Five-Two-Five Star Hotel for, what we thought was gonna be, Beinn England II. Parked up in the hefty tilted mish cawr pawrk for bolognese round two and a disc (Smugglers Blue's and Rites of Passage). And a crate of course, because I'm pretty seasoned now. Woke up at 5:30 absolutely fine though. Anyway too much depressing rain for the 18 miler so we headed up to the Pass of Drumochter for Beinn The Two I Didn't Do When I Was Uprighting The `sta. Successful proj followed by a successful trip to Bruar for some b'day presents and a coffee, large.",
