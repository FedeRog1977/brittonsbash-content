  "description": "I didn't think I'd be back on The Cobbler for a third time this year after The Playground and Last Day of Summer? however, it of course never disappoints. It was also good to finally see The Cobbler in the clag. I've only conquered this hill in clear, sunny conditions so it was good to experience the ESE face in slightly more awkward conditions. I say this was a SUMC walk but I did the ascent on my own coz I wanted the chad 120bpm run-in heart rate and I don't believe in the `taking breaks' hoax but, was joined by three excellent gents on the descent. The route took me almost three hours, hitting three segment PRs on the way. I have no clue how good that time is overall though coz I've never done this hill on it's own. So yes, I did have Narnain, Ìme, Vane and Vorlich blue balls by the end of it.",
