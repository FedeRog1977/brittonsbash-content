  "description": "Well sadly the repeat of the first Final Two'er couldn't happen. Roads were closed and Glunky Bunky was out of the cards. We desperately needed somewhere to get wasted so planning needed to occur fast. ASAP. Back to the caravan it was. It took quite a bit of messing about logistically with the child of the group, but hey ho. Turned out to still be a great one. We got wasted and exchanged christmas presents at Griff's on Friday then shot off, drum-and-welly-in-hand, on the Saturday. It's, like last time, a bit of a blur. A lot of beer, a lot of downing wine, a lot of food. But what I do know is, service was good. Even given the inability to roast vegetables in the oven, and the slightly undercooked welly. All a good one. Even followed with some darts at a very confused pub.",
