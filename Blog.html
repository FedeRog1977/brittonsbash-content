BlogShell consists of a series of links to blog posts which explore my hobbies, interests, thoughts, general activities, ideas, etc. DebunkQuickie consists of a series of short statements which I immediately feel the need to address. As dumb as they may be, it&rsquo;s likely stuff that has p&ast;ssed me off. They may also be pretty meme worthy.</p>

				<!--<button class="collapsible">&ldquo;Wages should be consistent&rdquo; - False</button>
				<div class="content">
					<p>I do not believe a wage is the correct way to incentivise productivity in the majority of career paths. I believe cash flow should directly reflect your ability to perform and delivery. A good existing example of this is real estate. Brokers are paid a wage by the brokerage simply due to standard employment regulation. However, their real income stems from commission on closing deals and selling properties. This averages ~3% in New York City. This is an accurate way of reflecting the broker’s performance - I.e. they have arranged redevelopments, faced homes, held open-houses, managed the majority of the paperwork, been an intermediary to architects, interior designers etc. and, found the final buyer. Therefore, it is only appropriate that their final pay is a directly proportionate cut of the final selling price of the home - as the selling price reflects the hierarchical level of the property, which reflects the level of effort and productivity required to seek the final output.</p>
				
					<p>A good example of a role which requires this upgrade is research and development. For example, at a technology corporation or university etc. I have a strict ‘no reference’ rule for this feature however, there have been studies conducted which show high payoff potential conclusions to research are more incentivising than a low consistent wage. Therefore, it would make far more sense to reward researchers proportionately to what they achieve. Supplemented by a minimum employment wage, in-line with employment regulation. People have been found to become more motivated and effective when (1) they don’t have a good wage to rely on and (2) they have opportunity to take more risk for more payoff. Thus, the std.dev from the original mean pay-off/wage increases drastically.</p>

				<button class="collapsible">&ldquo;You have money Lewis, you can buy anything you want&rdquo; - False</button>
				<div class="content">
					<p>I do not consider rich to be tied to a position to buy something or having a certain number associated with your checking or savings account etc. I don’t believe if you have a $2m car or $40m house that you are rich. To truly be ‘rich’ in wealth, I believe that you must have projected subsequent cash flows in perpetuity which will replenish cash used to purchase absolutely anything at any point in time. For example, you buy a yacht for $10m, you are not rich simply because you own this yacht. I would consider you to be ‘rich’ if you had a cash flow next month of $11m, thus replacing the cost of the yacht. You should then subsequently have the cash flows which would allow you to repeat this every month, or repeating every period you consider to be a cash flow period - e.g. quarter, semi-annually etc.</p>

				<button class="collapsible">&ldquo;Sweating more is a sign of good health&rdquo; - False</button>
				<div class="content">
					<p>This is a very poor and narrow statement as you will not sweat more simply because you are fitter. If however, because you are fitter, you tend on average to walk, run, cycle etc. faster, the excessive sweating can be attributed to this. Greater levels of fitness has been found to correlate with reduced sweating. Therefore, if you are a practicer in good fitness, excessive sweating can be explained by a greater probability of sweating brought by your increased pace, than there is reduced probability of sweating from better fitness.</p>

				<button class="collapsible" style="text-align:left">&ldquo;Eating excessively makes you fat&rdquo;</button>
				<div class="content">
					<p>There is a common misconception, often found among boomers, your parents, grandparents, people who get their information from news sources such as BBC, ITV, and just general imbeciles with no capacity to care for or be informed about health and fitness. This is that, to loosely quote: &ldquo;eating a great amount of food, or excessive poor quality meals will make you fat&rdquo;. This is in no way a linear issue and conclusions cannot be reached simply based upon that statement. I am in no way supporting regular consumption of poor quality/fast-foods etc. However, this issue is not complex and does need to be fully understood to gain a better relationship with food consumption. This to be honest is a very simple topic however, fails to be recognised by many people.</p>
				
					<p>First off, when many people eat a large meal which may not consist of the &lsquo;healthiest&rsquo; of ingredients, they immediately think they will gain &lsquo;weight&rsquo;. What they refer to here, but fail to realise, is bodyfat. This is completely false. These people fail to account for sodium and water intake throughout the past 24hrs etc. For example, upon wakening the next morning after a large salty Asian meal such as a Thai curry, you may weigh-in ~1kg heavier than you did the previous morning. It is very likely that less than 1% of this additional weight is bodyfat, where it will actually primarily consist of water held by the spike in sodium during the meal. Other factors such as the types of carbs and fats contained within the meal can also effect water retention. Of course you must also consider allergies causing swelling. This weight will be dropped in a matter of hours or days depending on the severity, simply by returning to your regular maintenance intake.</p>
				
					<p>Next, I&rsquo;ll refer to a couple of studies conducted by big names in mainstream media, regarding activity level and overeating. As we all should understand by now, weight gain is simple. You must simply consume more than your daily maintenance intake in order to gain body fat. Intuition tells us that eating in excess of your maintenance while practicing muscle-building activities will turn a portion of the gained weight to muscle whereas, eating in excess of your maintenance while sedentary will encourage fat gain. Weight gain does not necessarily depend on whether you&rsquo;re eating more &lsquo;fat&rsquo; etc., additional protein-based food will also be converted to fat in excess. It simply depends on how you utilise the extra calories. Thus, in theory of you ate 4000 &lsquo;unhealthy&rsquo; calories a day but had a maintenance of 2500 calories and a workout of 1500, you would not gain weight. That bring us to the studies. First is ErikTheElectric, a famous (and very fit/healthy) food challenge YouTuber. In a reent experiment, he consumed 5000 calories of pure McDonalds everyday for 1 week. His manitenance lies around 3000 calories and he practiced 200 calorie daily bike rides. On the eighth day (one day post-challenge), he had gained 5lbs. On the ninth day, this weight gain dropped to only 0.25lbs. Therefore allowing hom to draw the conclusion that with excessive consumption of poor quality &lsquo;fatty&rsquo; foods but sufficient calories burned to satisfy the threshold, 95% of the weight gained was water, simply die to the sodium spike from the McDonalds recipes. On the other hand is the world-famous <i>SuperSize Me</i> short film. The host of this conducted almost an identical experiment with very similar gross weight gain (water + bodyfat + &epsilon;) after a week, but this gain was primarily bodyfat due to his lack of ability to match the number of calories in-taken with his output. I.e. his sedentary lifestyle (consumed daily: ~5000 cals; exerted daily: ~1800 cals). My argument is satisfied.</p>
