        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          Those who know me know there&rsquo;s a bunch of random nonsense I
          could start spewing out here already, but let&rsquo;s keep it high
          level right now and you can dive into the l&rsquo;autisme as much as
          you want at your leisure. There are eight focuses of this website
          really, meaning there are eight things that sum up my effed-up
          personality: sport, exploration and travel, computers, academic crap,
          cooking, design, automotive interests, and other media. I have some
          trademarks, too many to get into here but you will be seeing a lot of
          hill Projects, including my greatest achievement of The Playground,
          and many more around my greatest love: the Scottish Highlands; Roadie
          Miles, including my century and various Strathavens and Fenwick + Wind
          Farms; Miles Miles, which these days tends to only extend to my
          never-ending Waterfoot streak; and, my (unfortunately) decaying
          obsession with Roger Federer&rsquo;s tennis game. You can also browse
          all of my travel and explorations, shall we call them, on my rebellion
          against Instagram: Instant Gram. And feel free to steal any of the
          recipes you find in BrittonsFoodRC too. You may at some point find
          yourself caught in some obscure exploration of interiors, design,
          typography, stationery, classic goods collection, and media
          collection, etc. There&rsquo;s also plenty of v-gin dev stuff in
          Linux, LaTeX, and web development. Also, not to forget the ThinkPads.
          If you are to venture into the unknown, check out Conquest (Burning
          Roots) and get a proj on the go in my experimental
          Ordnance-Survey-based mapping app. So yeah, good luck, have fun.
