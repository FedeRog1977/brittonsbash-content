  "description": "First Lady Jooma `J. Herman Vitra Miller' Loor's first Friday functional proj. It was into the `stallion for an 800er and drive-in to Atholl. Quickie in Tesco Perth for some so little calorie and Kate Moss Marshmello edition. Then, an attempt at the Atholl Arms but a phat rejection. Alright us because where there's a business problem, we provide and install the business solution. Tents up and a Tootie Brookie each before bed. Good proj the next day before finally hitting up Ka Ka Lok for one of the fist meals.",
