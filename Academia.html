				<h2>B.A. in Finance</h2>
	
				<h3>Honours Dissertation</h3>

				<p>My honours is titled as follows: <i>New York&rsquo;s Seasonal Effect: Further Analysis of New York&rsquo;s Interlinking and Turn-of-the-Year Seasonal Stock Return Fluctuations with Evidence from the NYSE, NASDAQ and S&P 500. </i>It focuses on time-series analysis of US stock returns, in search of Seasonal Patterns in the Weekend Effect, January Effect and Holiday Effect which contradict Efficient Market Hypothesis. Utilising mathematical and statistical methods such as regression analysis.</p>

				<h3>Theoretical Finance (Corporate &amp; Investment)</h3>
	
				<p>The second-year class AG215 explored topics including capital budgeting, capital depreciation, leasing, inventory optimisation, and corporate risk. The third year class AG312 focused on asset backed securities, real options, the Black &amp; Scholes model, and international financial management. These classes involved an Excel and Visual Basic-based capital budgeting project and a written project based on the 2008 financial crisis which focused on mortgage-backed securities. The fourth year classes AG430 and AG431 explored various topics in mergers and acquisitions, payout policies, agency theories, capital structure, market timing, IPOs, SEOs and debt. These included projects on payout policy of Tesco and Cineworld during the China Plague, and the 2017 merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management.</p>

				<h3>Empirical Fianance (Securities &amp; Derivatives)</h3>

				<p>The second year class AG217 focused on portfolio management and security analysis, extending to mean variance analysis, Sharpe testing, general asset pricing and bond pricing. This class also involved factor testing methods. The third year class AG313 focused on international risk and exchange and options/future derivative pricing. These classes involved a MATLAB-based portfolio optimisation project and a written international exchange risk project. The fourth year classes AG428 and AG432 primarily involved empirical methods in logistic regression, linear factor models and more extensive portfolio testing. Both projects again involved MATLAB &lsquo;BloatLAB&rsquo;.</p>

				<h3>Microeconomics with Econometrics</h3>

				<p>Second year microeconomics EC215 introduced budget constraints, preferences, cost minimisation, profit maximisation, advanced economic algebra and calculus, supply, demand, technology and monopolistic/oligopolistic operations. The third year expansion of this class EC315 focused on more specific topics such as game theory; exploring dominating corporate strategies and further profit optimisation. Furthermore, topics in public economics included equity distribution, commodity tax, cost benefit analysis, fiscal federalism, program/policy analysis and crime and punishment. This class included a Gretl project accounting for the cross-sectional econometric regregression portion of this class.</p>

				<h3>Macroeconomics with Econometrics</h3>

				<p>The second year class of this variety EC216 introduced the models of consumption and GDP, labour, and monetary and fiscal policy. The class gave a brief introduction to econometric statistics and data analysis. The third year class EC316 expanded upon these theories and analyses; exploring economic growth, saving, capital and output, technological progress, expectations and investment/consumption, econometric GARCH models, time-series correlation, cointegration and error correction. The econometric portion was again executed through the statistical analysis GUI Gretl.</p>

				<h2>University Roles</h2>

				<h3>ScottishPower Scholar</h3>

                                <p>Proceeding to my masters course in 2021, in software development, I applied for a computer science scholarship with ScottishPower. The process involved small tests, interviews, and a presentation based on the ScottishPower mobile application. I was accepted to the scholarship.</p>

				<h3>Student Ambassador</h3>			

				<p>In 2019 I wanted to expand my reach in my university and dig deeper into their operations. I found an opportunity to aid the Student Ambassador team with the 2019 Undergraduate Open Days. My involvement in these open days subsequently led to me applying for and being accepted for enrolment upon a position as a permanent Student Ambassador, with responsibilities such as touring, giving talks, organising university events, and all things alike. I will hold this role until graduation. Note that this is technically &lsquo;employment&rsquo; as I&rsquo;m on the payroll of my institution however, well... y&rsquo;know.</p>

				<h3>Widening Access Team</h3>
			
				<p>In 2019 I also joined the Strathclyde Widening Access Team who aim to extend the reach of the university&rsquo;s admissions and encourage lower progression rate schools to accelerate their achievements and efforts in school, in order to progress to university. This scheme exists to positively effect the university&rsquo;s image and reputation, and has done an excellent job of this in previous years. In 2019/2020 I was head of logistics and had a large influence in other aspects of the One Step Forward Event. It was an event aimed at bringing low progression-rate-school students to the university, giving them an enhanced introductory view of what could be theirs; in anticipation of encouraging them to accelerate their effort and improve grades. This event was planned to 100% completion, with myself acquiring visitors such as Ernst &amp; Young. The event was never executed however due to &lsquo;COVID-19&rsquo;.</p>

				<h3>Unibuddy Mentor &amp; Advisor</h3>

				<p>As part of my Student Ambassador role, I accepted a Recruitment and International Office position which is designed to help prospective students make their decision regarding enrollment at an institution such as strathclyde. Much like the student ambassador role, my job is to inform and guide. It is an app or browser-based role, through an application named &lsquo;Unibuddy&rsquo;. Primarily, I answer questions regarding admissions, work style, work load, structure, university life, etc., through the integrated message service. I also provide blogs through my personal profile.</p>

				<h3>Team Leader</h3>

				<p>Through the majority of the group work at university, I have fallen into the role of team leader. Now, I hate the 5&rsquo;4&rdquo; puffer-jacket-wearing douchebag who consistently elects himself leader just as much as you do however, I practice a completely different method of becoming a leader. From day one, I aim to primarily gain the respect of my teammates and also, to put accross the idea that I am a suitable person to be in charge. The method follows: [1] enagage in confident and charismatic chat with teammates and staff leaders to develop a human element to the work - diffusing tension, [2] make frequent suggestions directly to the staff leader instead of just the team, [3] treat the staff member(s) and the team collectively as equals, [4] be the first-responder to emails, messages etc., [5] always make the skeleton plans of proposed work, [6] at the beginning do most of the preliminary work yourself, and [7] begin to make suggestions of what work teammates are best fitted to and suggest deadlines and targets - which will likely be accepted considering the first sign of guidance is usually welcomed, [8] help people but dont become their slaves - show them in practice and one-on-one how good your work is and give them a baseline to wrk from. [9] Lead!</p>
