  "description": "A weekend which was supposed to be spent on Mayer and Driesh turned into an interesting one in St. Andrews. The golden trio took to the FIVE with a tube and a drum looking to spend a quiet night in St. Andrews and brief ourselves in the morning over the weather. This however, tuned into a fat St. Andrews Shawarma House kebab followed by a crate and some stolen M&S good from their waste disposal unit with some of Taylor's roommates. Saturday, instead of on Mayar and Driesh, was spend grinding out some squash at the local courts. Good fun, although the weather did not live up to the `storms' as reported on the forecasts.",
