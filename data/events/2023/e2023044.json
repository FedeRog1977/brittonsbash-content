  "description": "The day had come at last. Lewis and his bitches, as labelled by one of the `bitches'. I must say, the final week's worth of work paid off. This was the greatest away day, China have nothing on this away day. Great success of an autistically interactive day, followed by one of the most successful wasteds of the year. Especially after discovering Drygate sell Double Disco Mango Smoothie 7.5% by the 440. Also nowt like a stumble to Shawarma King to sober up afterwards.",
