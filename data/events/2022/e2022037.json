The nought-point-nought-nought-five-five-hour drive-in was a success, with an 8:15 ressie at DorsiaVerna, until I found out the Pirellis couldn't take the heat on the mildly-stony single-tracks. Two flats meant it was Ben Hope foloowed by six hours of Miami Vice waiting for a tow truck to Ullerrpooul the next day. Pitched in a very inappropriate place and ran a Doomer depression Tesco meal deal dinner. Hit a sub-two'er the following day, in-line with Sunday tradition. It was probably the highlight of the trip. Got COLD quickly and headed to the Argyle Hotel for wasted, followed by a seafood dinner, followed by wasted. Monday was Doomer. We moved our tents to the campsite and ran the tour of the outdoor centre and localé cafés. Then the leisure centre, finally for a shower. Hit up a pizza truck afterwards. Tuesday was even more Doomer with my tyres being delayed til Wednesday, so it was another day at the leisure centre sauna and a Doomer pea and mint Tesco soup for dinner. And ahh jeez, a mouse ate my tent so we had to move pitch. It was an early Doomer bed one, although I didn't really get back to sleep after the craic kicked off with the First Lady's arm amputation because of the thunderstorm. Wednesday promised a new hope, the ALL was collected first-thing and it was off to Ben More Assynt. Successful proj. Groin injury for me however. So took the counterpart to Ben Kilbreck while I cought up on Better Call Saul in the ALL. Then the most Doomer issue of all kicked off. The midge attack had me running lengths of the road in the ALL with all the windows open. Only thing was, one didn't come back up. So yeah, 11:30pm set-off on the road home. Don't remember much of it tbh, fell asleep six times. So Griff had to take over at Bruar. There was a strong five hours of Doomer Jazz played on that drive-out. The best meme was realising my chain was on when I got home so it was another night in the ALL for me.",
