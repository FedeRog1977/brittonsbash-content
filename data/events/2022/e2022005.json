  "description": "What's up primals?! Typical start to the routine with sushware and elderflower in the back of the five. It was followed by an attempt at getting wasted in the Bridge of Orchy hotel but the d'weebs closed the bar at 10pm and didn't even take last orders. So no drunken purchases this time. Good leisurely 10am start to Saturday with CustomGrow420 house and weed t-shirt tour, then 30 minutes of a Need for Speed Heat M3 tuning video for the motivation. Sadly the Green Welly Stop was a simulated fail too, so Real Food Cafe it was en route home.",
