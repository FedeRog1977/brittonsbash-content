\begin{minipage}[t]{.80\linewidth}
	\textbf{Database Development:} The two classes in this course on databases, CS990 and CS992, explored the design and implementation of databases using Structured Query Language (SQL) with basic querying; and more abstract concepts of database implementation such as the structure and efficiency of relational vs. non-relational vs. hybrid databases, and further querying; respectively. Both classes involved regular lab sessions in which databases were to be built and queried; an assignment for the former which involved taking information and formulating a logical database design with appropriate relationships and tables which was then constructed and queried accordingly; and an assignment for the latter which explored theory behind the history and use of relational databases, the rise of non-relational systems, and the concept and design of hybrid ones.

\begin{minipage}[t]{.80\linewidth}
	\textbf{Object Oriented Programming:} This aspect also involved two classes, CS994 and CS995. These were based on Python and Java, respectively. As well as the regular lab sessions which were structured around providing the fundamentals of Python and Java, both of these classes involved basic assignments which put these developments into practice. The Python assignment involved the construction of a miniature weather application using JSON data. The Java one involved building various components of a functional library system.

\end{minipage}
\hfill\vline\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{.80\linewidth}
	\textbf{Software Engineering:} The two classes associated with this aspect, CS991 and CS993, were both more open-ended and focussed more so on the software design and engineering process. Although it could be argued that the first of the two could also have been related to object oriented programming as it involved mobile application development. I, however, chose to go down the route of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this case. As I most commonly do when presented with the option. The second was bases more so on standards and principals of project panning, design, workflow and management. These two classes were, once again, based on the delivery of assignments. The assignment for CS991 essentially involved the design and prototyping process of an application. This included elements such as working demonstrations and documentation, etc. There were two assignments for CS993 however, they both followed the same general framework: requirements gathering and ranking; user stories; project management, including software and team management; front-end (user interface) design and functionality; back-end design and functionality; test-driven development; and testing elements.

\hfill\vline\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{.80\linewidth}
	\textbf{Cyber Security \& Ethics:} This involved two classes, CS808 and CS978, which loosely tie together from an ethical point of view. The cyber security class involved structured elements of cryptography, steganography and authentication, malware, human security, network attacks, network defense, and threat modelling. There was a routine examination based on these topics. The class also involved an assignment based on the concept of steganography and the Least Significant Bit (LSB) approach; and the engineering of a command line based program using python which: encodes a message in a 24bit Bitmap (\texttt{bmp}) image using the Pillow Image Library (PIL); decodes the message from the image by: requesting a text file; reading, extracting and storing text within the file; checking the image size against the target text file size to ensure there is sufficient space to store the text; identify errors returning the user with a sufficient path; and fulfilling the PEP 8 standards. Furthermore, the ethics class involved an essay exploring ethical theory, values, principals, and their implementation; morals of accessibility including restrictions, malware and external intrusive action; privacy and regulation, data misuse and privacy, government and non-government intervention, and corporate responsibility.

Lakeland offered me development from all angles, social and economic. I’ve received multiple cases of praise regarding my ``impeccable'' customer service and understanding of social desires. I was trusted to open and close store, manage the store funds and stock and have perpetual input in the store marketing and sales. I provided a strong, kind and reliable face by adopting a customer-centric nature. My excellent relationship with my boss allowed transparency and freedom which translated to efficiency and a strong understanding of operations. Lakeland is a place of strong hierarchical and consumer intimacy and thus, provided me with great joy.

\section{Communications \& Interfaces}

\subsection{Usual Workflow}

I am developing and maintaining a sustainable and minimalist Linux system. I main a Lenovo ThinkPad T420 and burn an X220. I currently use the OS Manjaro on which I run i3-Gaps but with plans to transition to Suckless' dwm window tiling manager. I tend to spend my days in the text editor Vim, writing and compiling documents in {\LaTeX}/Markdown using primarily pandoc and pdflatex. This sometimes extends to Beamer-compiled slide shows. I'm also very familiar with my desktop workhorse and other machines running Windows XP and Windows 7 and, my MacBook Pro running MacOS.
