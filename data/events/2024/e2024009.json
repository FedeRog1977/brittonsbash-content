  "description": "I'd waited four hard months for this return. It was a hard one, but if I've learned anything from the last few years of roadie'ing, it's that winter cycles are not worth it. The hours of defrosting and raisin d*ck do not, okay sometimes do, make the stats worth it. It was hard being away from a loved one for so long, but wow it's good to be back.",
