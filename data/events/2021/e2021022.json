  "description": "Ben Strava.. The fine breasted lady with one leg and no head. At least that's what the GPX file suggests. What an amazing route. Some of the best views to date, and my first full inversion after Ben More and Stob Binnein's partial. It was a classic start with a rice sachet and monsterous portion of reduced Morrison's deli potatoes, along with some How I Met Your Mother, in the Saab dining room / cinema theatre. After the Miami Vice Brother's Keeper feature length pilot, it was off to the Saab's double bed all to myself while Craig pitched. It was a midge-ridden start to the round on Saturday but once I'd battled off my fatigue from the week of 3am starts and Fenwick-Wind Farm loops and we'd made our way through the fort of ferns and low-level clag, it was straight into a clean white blanket of cloud enclosing Glencoe and Glen Etive with all the famous peaks showing their heads.. Sloggy grass turned to dry scrambly rock and humid clag to a clear sky and warm breeze. Sadly cut short because of a severe lack of fill up points.",
