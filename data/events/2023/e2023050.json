  "description": "Well GOOD LORD, it finally happened. I'd say I was the lucky one on this day, but I have to say the lucky ones were probably Girff and Griff Jr. They got to see my hysterical response to meeting my heroes. Something which I'm sure will give them perpetual comic value. This was a project I was almost not even doing. The original plan was a wasted with McN on the Thursday, then a slow day on Friday. But no. No no no. Omega high leads to project. We took back to one of my favourite local routes: The Playground Jr. (Narnain, Ìme, and The Cobbler), and had an amazing routine round on the route up to the descent on Ìme, where I spotted someone familiar. Was it... Gerry?! After a brief introduction and handshake, there he was emerging from the horizon. Murray Wilkie. Life had been made. I could die any day now happily. What a way to close the year. We got a pic, took care of some formalities, and got on our way over The Cobbler and down in the dark. A full day of sunshine, omega high, snow, Gerry, Murray, and the last summer house of the year to top it off. What a day. What a year.",
