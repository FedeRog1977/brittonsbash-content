  "description": "I returned to my new owner, Lui, the following Thursday on my first solo West Highland line venture, ice axe in hand, with full intention of making it to the top this time. It was the birth of my `go to the highlands and send and all day hike without telling anyone' era. I'd planned a very different route which involved a traverse all the way from the NNE arête to the SW path from Beinn a' Chleibh. I made it to about 900m again when the snow storm which had been lingering over Lochaber all day finally made its way down to Tyndrum. It was my first white-out. I was lucky if I could see five meters ahead in the best of it. It of course would have been beautiful if it wasn't for the off-off-path vertical route I was taking. So at waist-deep snow, I made the executive decision to turn back once again. In days days following this, I began to think I was done with hiking. I'd always done it as a pass-time to this point, with friends, never really appreciating what it could mean for me.",
