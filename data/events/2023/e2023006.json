  "description": "This was another hopeful one. But hopeful in a different way. We went north as agreed in perpetuity, but were constantly hoping that the weather would stay good enough to actually do something. We ended up getting a decent Corbett in down Loch Leven. Winds were ridiculous and to be honest, pretty damn dangerous especially at the very exposed points. Hey ho, it's us. The belting of Odyssey Live helped the recovery, and banished the fear. Aterwards, we rocked up at the climbing centre for a quick browse, I almost bought a jacket, as standard. I didn't, not as standard. Then we tried to get a coffee but ran into the army of SUMC, so it was a quickie to the door after that. Ended up getting a decent one, alongside some gentleman's chips, in a pub in Kinlochleven. Some electronic darts too. Not very gentlemanly.",
