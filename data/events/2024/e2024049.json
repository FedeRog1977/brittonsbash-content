  "description": "Not really the Final Two'er to live up to last year, but it did the job. It didn't really kick off to the greatest of starts with the five-hour drive-in to Aviemore, through seven road accidents, horizontal snow, and a skating rink of abandoned vehicles at Drumochter. Hence the unplanned blackout on Friday night. It was probably the best option, it let me catch up on EV Optimise sleep 'til about 2pm on Saturday. My only urgency to get out of bed came from the need to replace the hotties' box of M&S biscuits before they realised there were none in the box. I failed. However, at least it was an in. They were square AF though, who goes to a hostel for two nights over the weekend, drinks tea, eats biscuits, and plays board games?! Safe to say the biggest success of the day was still the purchase of the new Mammut piece. We even failed on our attempt at a ski centre coffee, ended up in that asshole's Pine Marten. Saturday night just ended up being a harder repeat of Friday, with some v*rgin Harvey Maps playing card games (yeah I suppose I can't really insult those girls anymore), Christmas dinner, Craig getting blacked out by a gum pillow, and BEER. And on the topic of gum pillows, I can't conclude the discussions of Saturday night without a mention of the Top G SH433ER we met. Or should I say FKR. Finlay dude, it was a pleasure. You have a lot of hostel innocence yet to lose. Sunday was shit. I ruined my Mountain Equipment down jacket on the Morlich lap. Bruar Christmas shop is good though.",
