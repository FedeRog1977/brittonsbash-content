# Option 1 - Consumer Engagement

## Problem

Sparse and untidy distribution of users across interactive platforms

*Energy customers aren't highly engaged app users, most customers use our digital services to check and pay their bills.*

## Task 

From desktop to mobile - condensation and generalization

*Propose an innovative way to increase customer engagement to increase regular usage of our digital apps.*

\newpage

# Relevant Mobile App Pages

*These will be referenced throughout this text. This list does not exhaust possibilities.*

1. Home (user summary)
2. Plan (unique user identifier)
3. Meter Readings (user input page)
4. Energy Usage (user output page)
5. Card Payment (finance)
6. Direct Debit (finance)

\newpage

# Demographic

*These will be referenced throughout this text. This list does not exhaust possibilities.*

1. First Timers
2. Transitioners
3. Loyalists

\newpage

# Motivating Factors in Mobile Apps

1. Convenience, Reliability & Trade-Off
2. Progress \& Competition
3. General \& Financial Safety
4. Slight of Hand

# Convenience, Reliability \& Trade-Off

## Problem

* Many *Transitioners* and *Loyalists* still view desktop as the most convenient and efficient method
* There may not be a great-enough gap between desktop and mobile UI functionality. For every loss of functionality on desktop, there should be an equal or greater gain on mobile
* Not too much of an issue for younger, *First Timer*, users as they will tend to prefer mobile accessability without persuation 

## Enhancements

* Mobile apps must utilize mobile-only features to create the illusion that mobiles are more convenient
*  Making the *Meter Readings* page more efficient by including Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology

<!--
ScottishPower is one of the classics. It has a long-term relaible reputation and can be known as one of the `safe' options in energy providers. At least to my knowledge. This means that a large portion of the demographic is composed of long-time loyalists and possible transitioners looking for a better deal. Because of the generational status of these users, they may have adapted to the desktop UI in recent years but are still reluctant to download apps as their PC is a more accessible device to them.

Sometimes there isn't enough of a gap between a desktop UI and a mobile app. That is, frequently you don't just need to make a mobile app better, you must unfortunately make a desktop UI worse. The idea is that, especially with the older segments of the demographic, you create the illusion that a mobile app is more functional first by making unique features available on them and then by making those features rely on things only a smartphone may be capable of. This will make it appear as though the smartphone is more `capable' and therefore a more convenient method of transfering whats in a users mind, to text. As a desktop user, this makes me sad to say as the keyboard is the most efficient way of navigating anything but many firms now are simply removing features from desktop and making them only compatable with smartphone features.

Possibilities of this are quite expansive; they could include using optical character recognition technology for the meter readings page which allows the user to use a smartphone camera to take a picture of their readings in real life. This means users simply must check over inputted text, rather than inputting it themselves. This avoids the classic comments like ``my fingers are too big for that'' nonsence and theoretically should entice more older generations. OCR would hold-up fine with the cylindrical tickers on meters. Furthermore, ...

As always, there is the extreme solution of making other interfaces so bad that users hate them. For example, a 10GB transparrent picture on the desktop site so it takes forever to load; removing website functionality all together; reducing functionality and options available with telephone and mail services; etc.

# Progress \& Competition 

## Problem

* People don't just want to see low prices, they want to see progressively greater value
* There is already a page which allows you to view energy usage. This is good but it's mundane. Its comprised of status bars to represent cost and bar charts to represent cost over time. This relies heavily on the user having their own motivation to  
* The younger generation need competition to stimulate their prolonged interest in something. 

## Enhancements

* The *Energy Usage* page holds the potential to be extremely extensive and stimulating to competitive natures
* The use of a 'usage floor' and a 'usage ceiling' is a good starting place
* More precise analytics based on user definitions
* Cross-user competition for lower costs and energy usage
* These methods would be specifically effective with the energetic younger *First Timers*, and even the overly-competative neighborly da's (*Loyalists*)

<!--

Note: For this section, note that <i> denotes floating time periods such as `hourly', `daily', `weekly', `monthly', `annually', etc.

A usage floor and a usage ceiling can be used to start by making users competative with themselves. They already have historical prices and and energy usage available to view but this only makes them normalize to the median, perhaps mean, value over time. Creating a usage floor based on parameters defined by the users in a new app page gives them a motivating number to float towards. Objective parameters may include [what they'd like to pay on an <i> basis]; [how many appliances they run]; [the type of appliance (requires in-app estimate data)]; [how long appliances are used on an <i> basis]; etc. This would involve greater rear-end data holding and math capabilities however, nothing outwith the resources and statistcial capabilities already utilized in this app. The range of output from calculations here are good benchmark values for how little energy a user could consumer (floor) and how much they could consume (ceiling). This gives not only a possible range of variation for peace of mind, and a motivation to stay low, but also, has the capability to produce cost floor/ceiling estimates for the more money-amount-inclined users. Of course, to my dislike, questions/prompts for input of these parameters can be worded less pragmatically and more `humanly' to create harmony with the user. For the ease of matching data, most options should be presented in a slection manner, like a drop-down list. As always, time-series progression should be displayed to the user to create ongoing motivation.

Based on quite extensive data collected by ScottishPower from external sources (in-app estimate data) and from the users themselves (as previously and subsequently listed), analytics can be produced to highlight to the user which appliances they could better-optimize; providing further (relative to those listed above) suggestions. This section creates more specific goals for the user to follow and optimize their behaviours relative to. Subjective parameters may include [how much a user feels they need certain appliances (i.e. a rating/ranking of appliance importance which highlights perhaps unecessary usage in unimportant areas)], [at what times they require appliances (i.e. is there a better / more efficient time on the local grid to use this appliance?)], [is an appliance dependent upon another? (i.e. link tree between a user's appliances - do things need to be on at the same time? <e.g. ``Turn <lamp> off, you don't need it while using <ThinkPad X220 w/ ThinkLight>!''>)]. The output from this operation can be presented on a new app segment/page and with the classic optional push notifications. Very simply, a status page may include progress bars showing progression towards usage/cost goals, perhaps on specific appliances. And, a notification may read ``use <j> application <k> less per <l> to reduce energy usage/cost by <x>''. Again, time-series progression should be displayed to the user for ongoing motivation.

On a more corss-sectional note, user data can be shared to compare across the platform. Of course this involves a lot of data protection, user permissions etc. however, can be very effective amongst users who like to be more efficient than others. Maybe that's just me, I don't know. For example, users could be compared over total energy usage and costs, or on segments perhaps sorted specific to [region (streets, council areas)], [commonality in appliances] ... This surely would encourage users to spend and consumer more wisely, and making the app more enjoyable.

# General \& Financial Safety

## Problem



## Enhancements

* Facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, 2/3-factor authentication, dynamic passwords (OTP) (some of these may compromise convenience/efficicency)
* Monero (XMR), Neo (NEO), etc. accessability and interactivity


\newpage

# Slight of Hand

## Problem

## Enhancements

* User customization of UI to allow muscle memory and comfort/familiarity of thier preference
* Users' custom definitions of macros using dynamic gesture technology

<!--

Allowing users to fully customize the UI (layout, transitions, color scheme, etc.) can make them feel more familiar with the app and allow them to be more `snappy' through their full processes. Users may also create their own macros using recent developments in Android and Apple's dynamic gesturing; allowing the users to become familiar with their own gestures which make accesssability more efficient. This of course relies heavily on app compatability with these, very recent and incomplete, external technologies of a users device (which can vary in age and stage in life potentially leading to in-app issues). But, as thse become closer to reality, they should be implemented. The customization features also have to potential to sell further to the younger generations, creatin the illusion of something more `personal' in an era where it's fashionable to be as `unique' as possible
