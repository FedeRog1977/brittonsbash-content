I will be graduating from BA Finance this summer and I cannot express how ready I am to move past the type of theoretical teaching which prepares you for nothing but the ability to grind through a 1mx1m dataset on a bloated GUI such as Microsoft Excel. I value real, practical, applicable skills. Although my only academic background in computer science is high school Higher; for the formerly discussed reason, along with a vast selection of others, I took great interest in computer systems and machine efficiency in 2019 and have been developing a sustainable Linux setup since. I made the move from proprietary software in 2020 (i.e. MS products, Adobe, etc.) and now primarily use free software, unless a particular use of `specialised' (if you can even call it that) software is absolutely required. I stick to the command line. I use the text editor Vim and generally spend my days writing documents in LaTeX or Markdown. I use command line programs such as SC-IM, calcurse, mutt, cmus, etc., to replace other bloated modern software. I also have some experience in R and Python, both also from the command line. FYI, I daily an IBM ThinkPad T42, Lenovo ThinkPad X220 and sadly still a MacBook Pro 2015 (only until I fully move over to my versatile Linux system on the ThinkPads).

The point is, I can't wait to build upon my knowledge and understanding of important machine-based languages. A granted scholarship would not be a wasted investment in this case.

I developed my own barebones, no-bloat (okay there's a tiiiiny bit of JavaScript), website in 2020 to house everything there is about me. I registered a unique domain with Epik and host the site with GitHub pages.
