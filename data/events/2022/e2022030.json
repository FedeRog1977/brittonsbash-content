  "description": "This proj started with an excellent leg stretch for the ALL; First Lady Jooma and I took to the A9 with some John Mayer and Percy Pigs. After docking in the Newtonmore proj car park, it was sushware over a round of Mr. Tate's finest. The other kids had a quick bag before docking in the FIVE, then it was onto the Brothers In Arms beer garden. It was a proj however, so at a good sensible Supreme Gentleman's bedtime, it was time for the first use of the L'Hotel D'ALL / ALL Inn and the FIVE-TWO-FIVE Star Hotel. It was a late rise the next morning for a quick double-down bag of Beinn Two Behind Those Ones Mark and Craig Did When I Was Uprighting. We hit up House of Allroads afterwards for a quickie ice crémà and some lorne for the next day. AwazFM and I ran some pretty damn good steak and mac-cheese for diesel, over a bottle of Wilmslow's finest Casa Italinio Chianti. Capped the night with an even more successful one at the Dalwhinnie lodge where we double-downed on pint and cocktail each round. I'm pretty sure that, even though we didn't realize it, we were kicked out. Back at Lee's, Jooma and I ran a night cap of Ferris Bueller's Day Off over six teas. Ran a couple' lorne for brekkie the next day then hit up Beinn One Hundred across from Beinn Day Before while AwazFM uprighted it in the FIVE.",
