      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Those who know me know there&rsquo;s a bunch of random nonsense I could
        start spewing out here already, but let&rsquo;s keep it high level right
        now and you can dive into the l&rsquo;autisme as much as you want at
        your leisure. There are eight focuses of this website really, meaning
        there are eight things that sum up my effed-up personality: sport,
        exploration and travel, computers, academic crap, cooking, design,
        automotive interests, and other media. I have some trademarks, too many
        to get into here but you will be seeing a lot of hill Projects,
        including my greatest achievement of The Playground, and many more
        around my greatest love: the Scottish Highlands; Roadie Miles, including
        my century and various Strathavens and Fenwick + Wind Farms; Miles
        Miles, which these days tends to only extend to my never-ending
        Waterfoot streak; and, my (unfortunately) decaying obsession with Roger
        Federer&rsquo;s tennis game. You can also browse all of my travel and
        explorations, shall we call them, on my rebellion against Instagram:
        Instant Gram. And feel free to steal any of the recipes you find in
        BrittonsFoodRC too. You may at some point find yourself caught in some
        obscure exploration of interiors, design, typography, stationery,
        classic goods collection, and media collection, etc. There&rsquo;s also
        plenty of v-gin dev stuff in Linux, LaTeX, and web development. Also,
        not to forget the ThinkPads. If you are to venture into the unknown,
        check out Conquest (Burning Roots) and get a proj on the go in my
        experimental Ordnance-Survey-based mapping app. So yeah, good luck, have
        fun.
