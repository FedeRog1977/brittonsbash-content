  "description": "The last days of summer were here again... half way through April. There is no place I'd rather have spent them to be honest, than one of the greatest springtime sunshine / get f*cked up locations on earth. The drinking aspect of these weekends has now snuck into the Fridays too. The Cairngorm Wildcat and Cairngorm Black Golds staring at me from the reception fridge were just too tempting. Much like the Freezing Peppermint Velos. Saturday's route took C. Vim on a full repeat project, but I managed to get two new ticks in, finishing with a rebag of Macdui to make it a loop. We made it down in record time, and it was delightful to have only a 10 minute drive back to the hostel, rather than a two hour one. Gave us some fantastic additional Reels time from bed. Good lord the venison burger ragu was inhaled too. Masterpiece. Then onto the most important part of the night, the CHOUFFEs and Tripel Hops. We even had to make an emergency trip to Snow Mountain, after calling one in, for some salt and chilli; Tesco for an easter egg, then onto M&S BP for some Desperados. The night goes on. Then we blacked out. It was hard to rise the next morning, but we somehow still get Ainsley in. It was more of a food hangover this time than alcohol sadly, as opposed to last week's. Those f*ck. But the Bruar venison and desk certainly cured me on Sunday night.",
