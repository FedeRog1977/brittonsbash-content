  "description": "As sparse as they may be at the moment, this one managed to fill a large gap. It was to Inverness Youth Hostel on Friday night after another good week of symmetrical ones-in on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. A quick chicken breast and tortilla dinner, then bed for the 7am start. The Saturday proj was good, though I have to say I'm a little disappointed that it took the place of my longest project of all time, as it certainly comes far down the difficulty list. It was all walk-in and walk-out. In fact, the actual hill section was only 3 miles. I'd never complain though, it was an excellent day, and 24 miles more than the average person is doing, so we're still on a winner there. We had a stop in the Spar at Strathcarron afterwards and found an excellent hidden gem; certainly up there with the European Spars! The white Monster also replenished some diesel. Then back to the hostel for king prawn gnocchi, and a couple wheaties and Cherry CHOUFFEs. Sadly there was no getting f*cked up though, as it was another early-ish start the next day, RIP. We were so up for it too, as soon as we got control of the communal TV. And we only ended up finding out the next day that we should have just had a blasted session, as the 80mph gusts quite literally swept us off of our feet to the point of bail. Ah well, we still got 9 miles and around 2,500ft of ascent in. And a stop at Bruar!",
